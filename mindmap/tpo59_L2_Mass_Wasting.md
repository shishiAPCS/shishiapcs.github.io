### [TPO59 L2 Mass Wasting](https://t.weixue100.com/toefl/listening/62004.html) 

```
# TPO59 L2 Mass Wasting
- **Main Idea**: Discussion of mass wasting, particularly creep and solifluction, and their impact on the environment and infrastructure

## Creep
- More common type of mass wasting
- Soil moves slowly downhill due to gravity and water
- *Example*: Curved trees or tilted fences as evidence of creep

### Wet-Dry Cycles
- Occurs in warmer areas
- Wet conditions cause soil to expand, and dry conditions cause it to contract

## Solifluction
- Similar to creep, occurs in permafrost areas
- Soil moves uniformly down the slope as one large mass
- *Example*: Varying rates of solifluction in Spitsbergen, Norway, evidenced by stumps left over from a 1940 era structure

## Building on Slopes
- Not always the best idea
- Slopes can be stabilized in various ways

## Building on Permafrost
- Risky and should be avoided or done carefully
- Structures should be elevated on posts
- *Example*: Improper elevation can cause solifluction to destabilize the ground, leading to slides or flows and related problems
