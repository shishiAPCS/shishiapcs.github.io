# Astronomy Lecture: Sunspots <br> 天文学讲座：太阳黑子

## Introduction to Sunspots <br> 太阳黑子的介绍
- Sunspots, in the most basic terms, are dark spots on the Sun's surface. <br> 最基本的来说，太阳黑子就是太阳表面上的暗斑。
- The ancient Chinese were the first to record observations of sunspots as early as the year 165. <br> 中国古代人最早在公元165年就记录了对太阳黑子的观察。

## European Astronomers and Their Beliefs About Sunspots <br> 欧洲天文学家及其对太阳黑子的看法
- Early European astronomers believed that the Sun and other celestial bodies were perfect, without any flaws or blemishes. <br> 早期的欧洲天文学家认为太阳和其他天体都是完美的，没有任何缺陷或瑕疵。
- As such, they thought that sunspots were shadows of planets crossing the Sun's face rather than being features on the Sun itself. <br> 因此，他们认为太阳黑子是行星经过太阳表面时的影子，而不是太阳本身的特征。

## Galileo's Observations and Hypothesis <br> 伽利略的观察和假设
- Galileo, based on his observations in the early 1600s, pointed out that sunspots were not circular, which contradicted the belief that they were shadows of planets. <br> 伽利略在17世纪初基于他的观察指出，太阳黑子并不是圆形的，这与认为它们是行星的影子的观点相矛盾。
- He also observed that sunspots seemed to change shape as they moved across the Sun's surface, which would not be consistent with them being shadows of planets. <br> 他还观察到，太阳黑子在太阳表面移动时，形状似乎会发生变化，这与它们是行星的影子的说法不一致。
- Galileo proposed that sunspots were indeed a feature of the Sun, possibly clouds in the solar atmosphere. <br> 伽利略提出，太阳黑子的确是太阳的一个特征，可能是太阳大气层中的云。

## Sunspot Hypotheses and Discoveries <br> 太阳黑子的假设和发现
- Over the next couple of centuries, various hypotheses were proposed, including that sunspots were mountains or holes in the solar atmosphere. <br> 在接下来的几个世纪中，提出了各种假设，包括太阳黑子是山脉或太阳大气层中的洞。
- In 1843, astronomer Heinrich Schwabe, after 17 years of observing the Sun, found a repeating pattern of increase and decrease in the number of sunspots over a period of ten years. <br> 1843年，天文学家海因里希·施瓦贝在观察太阳17年后，发现太阳黑子的数量在十年的周期内呈现出增减的重复模式。
- Another astronomer, Wolf, confirmed the existence of this cycle after studying sunspots for forty years, but he detected an eleven-year cycle instead. <br> 另一位天文学家沃尔夫在研究太阳黑子四十年后确认了这种周期的存在，但他检测到的是十一年的周期。

## Connection Between Sunspots and Geomagnetic Activity <br> 太阳黑子与地磁活动的联系
- The eleven-year cycle of sunspots corresponds with the eleven-year cycle of natural fluctuations in the Earth's magnetic field, known as geomagnetic activity. <br> 太阳黑子的十一年周期与地球磁场的自然波动（即地磁活动）的十一年周期相对应。
- This correspondence sparked studies to understand the relationship between the Sun and the Earth, including whether sunspots cause geomagnetic fields or vice versa, or whether there is another factor causing both. <br> 这种对应关系引发了对太阳和地球之间关系的研究，包括太阳黑子是否导致地磁场，反之亦然，或者是否存在另一种因素导致两者产生。

## Sunspots and Magnetic Fields <br> 太阳黑子与磁场
- Astronomers eventually determined that sunspots are magnetic fields, explaining their dark appearance as magnetic fields reduce the pressure on the gases inside them, making the spots cooler and thus darker than the rest of the Sun's surface. <br> 天文学家最终确定太阳黑子是磁场，这解释了它们的暗淡外观，因为磁场减小了内部气体的压力，使得这些地方比太阳的其他表面更凉，因此看起来更暗。
