# Zoology Lecture: Principles of Classification and Gila Monsters <br> 动物学讲座：分类原则与吉拉怪兽

## Classification and Similarities Among Animals <br> 动物分类与相似性
- Classification in zoology is based on how certain types of animals are related to others and the similarities between different kinds of animals. However, some animals may be related to each other, despite some major dissimilarities. <br> 动物学中的分类基于某些类型的动物如何与其他动物相关，以及不同种类的动物之间的相似性。然而，尽管有一些主要的不同，某些动物可能彼此相关。

## Gila Monster: A Unique Type of Lizard <br> 吉拉怪兽：一种独特的蜥蜴
- Gila monsters are a type of lizard that primarily lives in the desert areas of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. <br> 吉拉怪兽是一种蜥蜴，主要生活在美国西南部和墨西哥北部的沙漠地区。

### Common Characteristics with Lizards <br> 与蜥蜴的共同特性
- Gila monsters share certain characteristics with all lizards, such as some features of the skull, jaw, and other parts of the skeleton, forelegs, a long tail, skin covered in scales, and a triangular head. These features are inherited from a common ancestor, which is why they are classified as lizards. <br> 吉拉怪兽与所有蜥蜴共享某些特性，如头骨、颌骨和骨骼的其他部分的一些特征，前腿，长尾，覆盖鳞片的皮肤，以及三角形的头。这些特性是从共同祖先那里遗传下来的，这就是它们被分类为蜥蜴的原因。

### Significant Difference: Venom <br> 重大差异：毒液
- Despite sharing characteristics with other lizards, Gila monsters are different in one significant way: they are venomous. This trait is more commonly associated with snakes. However, Gila monsters use their venom mainly for self-defense, whereas snakes use their venom to hunt and subdue prey. <br> 尽管与其他蜥蜴共享特征，但吉拉怪兽在一个重要方面不同：它们是有毒的。这个特性更常与蛇相关联。然而，吉拉怪兽主要使用它们的毒液进行自我防卫，而蛇则使用它们的毒液猎捕和制服猎物。

## Classification and Evolution <br> 分类和演化
- Similar features in different species may either be inherited from a common ancestor (indicating the species are related) or they may evolve independently. The venom systems of snakes and Gila monsters evolved independently and function differently, so it would be a mistake to classify them in the same category simply because they are both venomous. <br> 不同物种的相似特征可能是从共同祖先那里遗传的（表明物种是相关的），或者它们可能独立演化。蛇和吉拉怪兽的毒液系统是独立演化的，并且功能不同，所以仅仅因为它们都是有毒的，就将它们分类在同一类别中是错误的。

## Gila Monster Venom and Medical Breakthrough <br> 吉拉怪兽的毒液与医学突破
- Gila monsters produce a unique chemical in their venom that's being used in a new drug to fight type two diabetes. This could represent a significant medical breakthrough. Notably, this chemical doesn't occur in snakes or any other lizards. <br> 吉拉怪兽的毒液中产生一种独特的化学物质，这种物质被用于一种新药，用于对抗二型糖尿病。这可能代表一项重要的医学突破。值得注意的是，这种化学物质不出现在蛇或任何其他蜥蜴中。
