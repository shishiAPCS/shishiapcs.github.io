# TPO59 European Art Panorama
- The lecture discusses the history and significance of panoramas as a popular 19th-century art form that contributed to the realism movement in European art.

## Robert Barker
- Invented the panorama
- Painted the first official panorama in 1787
- Solved perspective problems in circular paintings
- Recognized the need for a special viewing space and obtained a patent

## Popularity and Expansion
- Panoramas became popular after 1800
- Special buildings were constructed to display them in major cities across Europe and North America

## Artistic Techniques
- Supervised by first-rate artists for faithful reproductions of scenes
- Techniques to intensify the illusion of reality
    - Special lighting effects
    - Hiding edges of the painting
    - Placing plants and trees between the viewer and the painting

## Innovative Perspectives
- Offered a full 360-degree view, often with a bird's-eye or aerial perspective
- Coincided with the debut of hot air balloons and the construction of the first high-rise buildings

## Popular Subjects
- Detailed views of the cities in which panoramas were exhibited
- Familiarity with the scenes was part of the fascination

## Decline in Popularity
- Waned in the second half of the 19th century due to illustrated newspapers and photography
- Many panoramas were painted over, cut up, or sold, leaving few examples to be preserved

### TPO59 L2 Mass Wasting 

```
# TPO59 L2 Mass Wasting
- **Main Idea**: Discussion of mass wasting, particularly creep and solifluction, and their impact on the environment and infrastructure

## Creep
- More common type of mass wasting
- Soil moves slowly downhill due to gravity and water
- *Example*: Curved trees or tilted fences as evidence of creep

### Wet-Dry Cycles
- Occurs in warmer areas
- Wet conditions cause soil to expand, and dry conditions cause it to contract

## Solifluction
- Similar to creep, occurs in permafrost areas
- Soil moves uniformly down the slope as one large mass
- *Example*: Varying rates of solifluction in Spitsbergen, Norway, evidenced by stumps left over from a 1940 era structure

## Building on Slopes
- Not always the best idea
- Slopes can be stabilized in various ways

## Building on Permafrost
- Risky and should be avoided or done carefully
- Structures should be elevated on posts
- *Example*: Improper elevation can cause solifluction to destabilize the ground, leading to slides or flows and related problems

# TPO59 L4 中世纪欧洲城镇经济活动及行会发展讲座

## 讲座主要思想
- 探讨中世纪欧洲城镇经济活动的发展
- 重点讲述行会（guilds）的作用和影响
- 商人行会和手工艺行会对城市经济发展和贸易扩张的贡献

## 主要观点和例子
1. **行会增加消费者信心**
   - 标准化权重和度量单位
   - 规范产品制作方式和质量
   - 例子：面包师制作的面包大小一致
2. **行会对成员有利**
   - 规定价格和工作时间
   - 不允许来自其他城镇的工匠或商人销售商品
   - 保护行会成员免受外部竞争的影响
3. **行会加入过程**
   - 学徒(apprentice)
   - 熟练工（journeyman）
   - 大师（master）
   - 例子：约7年的培训，凭借作品（masterpiece）获得行会成员认可
4. **女性在行会中的作用**
   - 与丈夫一起工作
   - 非正式的大师
   - 从事与丈夫工作相关的业务
   - 例子：面包师的妻子可能经营旅馆
   - 寡妇接管丈夫的职业并成为行会成员

## 行会的影响
- 17世纪大多数行会解散
- 现代劳工联盟和某些行业的学徒制度中仍有行会的影响
