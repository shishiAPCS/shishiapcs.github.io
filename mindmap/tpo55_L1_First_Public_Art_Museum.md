# 艺术史讲座：卢浮宫与艺术博物馆的演变

## 主要观点
1. 卢浮宫：第一个公共博物馆
2. Alexandre Lenoir：艺术博物馆的转变
3. 关于博物馆价值的争论

### 卢浮宫：第一个公共博物馆
- 1793年开放
- 第一个向公众开放的博物馆（以前的博物馆是由皇室和贵族拥有的私人收藏）
- 最初对艺术家免费开放；普通公众的访问受到限制
- 被视为艺术家的教育机构

### Alexandre Lenoir：艺术博物馆的转变
- 法国画家，法国大革命期间被任命为艺术品仓库的监督
- 1796年按时期和风格对艺术品进行分类和展示
- 他的仓库最终成为了法国国家纪念碑博物馆（后来成为卢浮宫的一个分支）
- Lenoir的分类和展示系统成为其他公共艺术博物馆的典范
- 认为博物馆应根据历史时期专注于公众教育和教学

### 关于博物馆价值的争论
- 批评者（包括艺术家和历史学家）认为博物馆会终结艺术
- 认为从原始背景中移除的艺术品是不完整的，应该保留在原来的地点
- 例子：意大利海滨村庄的绘画在被移到法国的博物馆后失去了其身份
- 今天这场争论仍在继续，有些人出于同样的原因对艺术博物馆持怀疑态度

# Art History Lecture: The Louvre and the Evolution of Art Museums

## Main Ideas
1. The Louvre: The first public museum
2. Alexandre Lenoir: The transformation of art museums
3. The debate on the value of museums

### The Louvre: The first public museum
- Opened in 1793
- First museum accessible to the public (prior museums were private collections owned by royalty and nobility)
- Originally free for artists every day; general public had limited access
- Seen as a teaching institution for artists

### Alexandre Lenoir: The transformation of art museums
- French painter assigned as supervisor of a storehouse for artworks during the French Revolution
- Classified and displayed artworks by period and style in 1796
- His storehouse eventually became the National Museum of French Monuments (later a branch of the Louvre)
- Lenoir's system of classification and display became a model for other public art museums
- Believed that museums should be focused on public instruction and education according to historical periods

### The debate on the value of museums
- Critics (including artists and historians) argued that museums would end art
- Believed that artworks removed from their original context were incomplete and should remain in their original locations
- Example: An Italian seaside village painting losing its identity when moved to a museum in France
- The debate continues today with some still skeptical of art museums for the same reasons
