# Economics Lecture: International Trade and Comparative Advantage <br> 经济学讲座：国际贸易与比较优势

## Recap: Reasons for International Trade <br> 回顾：国际贸易的原因
- Nations engage in international trade because they either have a surplus or a shortage of resources and goods. They trade to supplement what they cannot produce domestically.<br> 国家进行国际贸易是因为他们要么有资源和商品的过剩，要么有资源和商品的短缺。他们进行贸易是为了补充他们无法在国内生产的商品。

## Absolute Advantage <br> 绝对优势
- Absolute advantage is when a country can produce more of a product using fewer resources.<br> 绝对优势是指一个国家能够用更少的资源生产更多的产品。

### Example: Bananas in the United States <br> 例子：美国的香蕉
- The United States imports bananas from tropical countries that have an absolute advantage in producing them, even though it has the capability to grow bananas domestically.<br> 尽管美国有能力在国内种植香蕉，但美国从热带国家进口香蕉，这些国家在生产香蕉方面有绝对优势。

## Comparative Advantage <br> 比较优势
- Comparative advantage is about relative efficiency in producing different products. A country with a comparative advantage in producing a particular product should specialize in making that product and trade with others.<br> 比较优势是关于生产不同产品的相对效率。在生产某一特定产品上具有比较优势的国家应专门生产那种产品，并与其他国家进行贸易。

### Example: Country X and Country Y <br> 例子：国家X和国家Y
- Country X is more efficient at making TVs, while Country Y is more efficient at making chairs. Both should specialize in producing what they're most efficient at and trade with each other.<br> 国家X在制造电视上更有效率，而国家Y在制造椅子上更有效率。两国都应该专门生产他们最擅长的商品，然后进行交易。

## Opportunity Cost <br> 机会成本
- Opportunity cost is what you lose when you choose to use your time and resources for something else. It's a crucial concept for understanding comparative advantage.<br> 机会成本是你选择将时间和资源用于其他事情时所损失的东西。这是理解比较优势的一个关键概念。

### Example: Going to a Movie <br> 例子：去看电影
- The opportunity cost of going to a movie includes what else you could have spent your money on and what else you could have accomplished during the time you were watching the movie.<br> 去看电影的机会成本包括你本可以用这笔钱做其他什么，以及你在看电影的时候本可以完成的其他事情。
