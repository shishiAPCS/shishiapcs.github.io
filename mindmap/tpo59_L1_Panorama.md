     - Techniques to intensify the illusion of reality
     - Special lighting effects
     - Hiding edges of the painting
     - Placing plants and trees between the viewer and the painting

     ## Innovative Perspectives
     - Offered a full 360-degree view, often with a bird's-eye or aerial perspective
