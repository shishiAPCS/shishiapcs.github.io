# Earth Science Lecture: Continental Polar Air Mass <br> 地球科学讲座：大陆极地气团

## Definition and Origin of Continental Polar Air Masses <br> 大陆极地气团的定义和起源
- An air mass is a large body of air with uniform properties in terms of temperature and moisture. <br> 气团是具有统一温度和湿度特性的大气团。
- Continental polar air masses originate over continents near the poles, which are typically cold and dry. <br> 大陆极地气团源自靠近极点的大陆，那里通常寒冷干燥。
- The polar air masses from the Arctic in Northern Canada largely influence weather patterns in the United States, especially east of the Rocky Mountains. <br> 来自北加拿大北极的极地气团在很大程度上影响了美国的天气模式，特别是洛基山脉以东的地区。

## Characteristics and Impact of Continental Polar Air Masses <br> 大陆极地气团的特性和影响
- Continental polar air masses are typically not associated with heavy precipitation. They remain dry and cold throughout their journey across North America, bringing clear skies and cooler temperatures to the eastern United States during winter. <br> 大陆极地气团通常与大降水无关。它们在横跨北美的过程中保持干燥和寒冷，为美国东部的冬季带来晴朗的天空和较冷的温度。
- However, when a polar air mass passes over the Great Lakes region in late autumn and winter, it can cause heavy snowfalls. These snowstorms, known as lake effect snows, derive their moisture from the Great Lakes themselves. <br> 然而，当极地气团在深秋和冬季穿过大湖地区时，可能会引起大雪。这些雪暴被称为湖效雪，其湿气来自大湖本身。

## Lake Effect Snows: The Process <br> 湖效雪：过程
- During the summer, bodies of water, especially large ones like the Great Lakes, absorb significant amounts of energy from the sun and warm summer air, becoming large reservoirs of heat. The land, in contrast, doesn't store heat as efficiently and gets colder faster during the cold seasons. <br> 在夏季，水体（特别是像大湖这样的大型水体）从太阳和温暖的夏季空气中吸收大量的能量，变成了大型的热量储藏库。相比之下，陆地不能有效地储存热量，在寒冷季节中变冷得更快。
- When a dry continental polar air mass moves across the relatively warm lakes, the warm, moist air from the lake rises into the cold, dry air above, leading to the formation of clouds and snowfall over the lake and on the downwind shores. <br> 当一个干燥的大陆极地气团横穿相对温暖的湖面时，湖水中的温暖湿润的空气上升到上面的冷干空气中，导致云的形成和湖面及下风岸的降雪。

## Predictions for the Future <br> 对未来的预测
- Many scientists predict that lake effect snowstorms will increase in frequency and intensity over the course of this century due to the average temperature of the Great Lakes' surface waters increasing. <br> 许多科学家预测，由于大湖表面水温的平均温度上升，湖效雪暴的频率和强度将在本世纪内增加。
- However, if air temperatures continue to rise in the next hundred years, polar air mass temperatures will too, and winter could be much milder. This could lead to more precipitation falling as rain instead of snow if the air isn't cold enough to support snowfall. <br> 然而，如果在未来一百年内气温继续上升，极地气团的温度也将上升，冬季可能会变得更温和。如果空气不够冷以支持降雪，这可能会导致更多的降水以雨的形式而非雪的形式下降。
