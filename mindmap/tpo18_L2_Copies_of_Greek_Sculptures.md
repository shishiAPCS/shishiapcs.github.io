# Art History Lecture: Copies of Greek Sculptures in Ancient Roman Art <br> 艺术历史讲座：古罗马艺术中的希腊雕塑复制品

## Introduction to Roman Sculpture <br> 罗马雕塑的引言
- The lecture focused on the practice of Roman sculptors often creating copies of famous Greek sculptures. <br> 本次讲座的重点是罗马雕塑家常复制著名的希腊雕塑的做法。

## Roman Conquest and the Influence of Greek Art <br> 罗马的征服和希腊艺术的影响
- In the late fourth century B.C., the Romans began a campaign to expand the Roman Empire and within 300 years, they had conquered most of the Mediterranean area and parts of Europe. <br> 在公元前四世纪末，罗马人开始了扩大罗马帝国的运动，在300年内，他们征服了大部分地中海地区和欧洲的部分地区。
- The Roman army returned to Rome with many works of Greek art, which may have sparked admiration and influence on Roman culture. <br> 罗马军队带回了许多希腊艺术品，这可能在罗马文化中激起了赞赏和影响。

## Traditional View vs Gazda's Challenge <br> 传统观点 vs Gazda 的挑战
- The traditional view in art history suggests that Roman artists copied Greek sculptures because they lacked creativity and skill. <br> 艺术史上的传统观点认为，罗马艺术家复制希腊雕塑是因为他们缺乏创造力和技巧。
- Contemporary art historian Elaine Gazda challenges this view, suggesting that the Romans might have had other motivations, such as admiration for Greek sculpture, and that copying required a significant amount of skill, time, and effort. <br> 当代艺术历史学家 Elaine Gazda 挑战了这个观点，她认为罗马人可能有其他动机，比如对希腊雕塑的欣赏，而且复制需要大量的技巧、时间和努力。

## Function and Meaning of Statues in Roman Culture <br> 在罗马文化中雕像的功能和含义
- According to Gazda, Roman statues were not simply decorative; they had specific functions and conveyed meanings. <br> 据 Gazda 说，罗马雕像不仅仅是装饰性的；它们有特定的功能和传达的含义。
- For example, under the emperor Augustus, portrait statues and Roman coins with the emperor's face were distributed throughout the empire to communicate specific ideas about the emperor and the imperial family, and to familiarize inhabitants of the conquered areas with the Roman way of life. <br> 例如，在奥古斯都皇帝的统治下，带有```markdown
皇帝肖像的雕像和罗马硬币被分发到帝国各地，以传达关于皇帝和皇家家族的特定观念，并使被征服地区的居民熟悉罗马的生活方式。

## Original Roman Sculptures, Copies and Their Techniques <br> 原创罗马雕塑、复制品及其技术
- While some Roman sculptures were original works, many were exact copies or modified versions of Greek statues. This included combining elements of different Greek statues or attaching a Roman's head to the body of a Greek god or athlete. <br> 尽管有些罗马雕塑是原创作品，但许多都是希腊雕塑的精确复制品或修改版。这包括结合不同希腊雕塑的元素，或者将罗马人的头部附在希腊神或运动员的身体上。
- The Romans were known to make plaster casts from molds of the sculptures, then replicate them in marble or bronze in workshops across the empire. This way, they could create statues with removable heads, allowing them to depict an emperor in various roles or even replace the head with that of the next emperor. <br> 众所周知，罗马人会从雕塑的模具中制作石膏模型，然后在帝国各地的车间里用大理石或青铜复制它们。这样，他们可以创造出可移动头部的雕塑，使他们能够描绘皇帝扮演的各种角色，甚至可以用下一位皇帝的头替换掉原来的头。
