# European History Lecture: The Role of Spices in the Middle Ages <br> 欧洲历史讲座：中世纪香料的角色

## Definition and Origins of Spices <br> 香料的定义和起源
- A spice is an aromatic part of a plant that is not a leaf, or herb. It can come from tree bark (like cinnamon), plant roots (like ginger), or flower buds (like cloves). <br> 香料是植物的有香味的部分，不是叶子，也不是草本。它可以来自树皮（如肉桂）、植物根（如姜）或花蕾（如丁香）。
- In the Middle Ages, Europeans were familiar with many spices, the most important being pepper, cloves, ginger, cinnamon, mace, and nutmeg. These spices had a significant influence on how Europeans lived, traded, and imagined. <br> 在中世纪，欧洲人熟悉许多香料，最重要的是胡椒、丁香、姜、肉桂、豆蔻和肉豆蔻。这些香料在很大程度上影响了欧洲人的生活、贸易和想象。

## Importance of Spices in the Middle Ages <br> 中世纪香料的重要性
- Spices, native to the East Indies, had to be imported into Europe, which made them incredibly valuable due to high transportation costs. For instance, in 408 A.D., a Gothic general who captured Rome demanded 3,000 pounds of pepper as part of his payment. <br> 香料原产于东印度群岛，必须进口到欧洲，由于运输成本高昂，使它们价值极高。例如，在408年，一位占领罗马的哥特将军要求作为他的付款的一部分，提供3000磅的胡椒。
- In the relatively bland diet of the time, especially among the aristocracy who consumed a lot of meat, spices offered new tastes and ways of preparation. <br> 在那时相对单调的饮食中，尤其是在食肉量大的贵族中，香料提供了新的味道和烹饪方式。
- The myth that medieval Europeans used spices to cover up the taste of spoiled meat is not accurate. Those who could afford spices could afford fresh meat. Spices were actually used to improve the taste of preserved, salted meat. <br> 中世纪欧洲人使用香料掩盖变质肉的味道的这一神话并不准确。那些能负担得起香料的人也能负担得起新鲜的肉。香料实际上是用来改善保存的、咸肉的味道。

## Spices and the Medieval Imagination <br> 香料和中世纪的想象力
- When the Roman Empire collapsed in the 5th century and direct trade stopped, the spices started to take on an air of mystery, their origins shrouded in exotic travels. <br> 当罗马帝国在5世纪崩溃，直接贸易停止时，香料开始带有神秘的气息，他们的起源被隐藏在异国的旅行中。
- Spices were not just for eating, they were considered magical, used as medicines, mixed into perfumes, incense, and used in religious rituals. <br> 香料不仅仅是用来吃的，它们被认为是神奇的，被用作药品，混入香水、香料，并在宗教仪式中使用。
- The pursuit of spices spurred on the age of discovery in the 15th and 16th centuries, with explorers like Columbus, Da Gama, and Magellan setting off not in search of a new world, but for spices. <br> 在15和16世纪的发现时代，像哥伦布、达·伽马和麦哲伦这样的探险者并不是为了寻找新世界，而是为了寻找香料，这种追求刺激了人们的探索精神。
