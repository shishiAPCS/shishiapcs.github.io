# TPO58 L3
The lecture focuses on the Harlem Renaissance, its significance in the United States culture and history, and its major figures and their works. It also discusses the factors that contributed to the Renaissance and the broader social context of the time.

## Harlem Renaissance
- Literary awakening among African Americans
- Characterized by assertiveness and creativity

### Major Figures
- Langston Hughes
  - Captured African American folk traditions
  - Incorporated blues, jazz, spirituals, and African American musical forms into his poetry
  - First to write a gospel play

- Zora Neale Hurston
  - Celebrated African American folk traditions

  - Infused dialect, folklore, and anthropology in her work

### Geographical Scope
- Not limited to Harlem, New York City
- Also occurred in other urban areas (Washington, D.C., Chicago, Cleveland)
- More general term: New Negro Renaissance

### Historical Debate
- Some historians attribute the start of the Harlem Renaissance to movements in the early 1900s
  - W.E.B. DuBois' publication of "The Souls of Black Folks" in 1903
  - DuBois' concept of "double consciousness"
  - The Niagara Movement in 1906 (led to the formation of civil rights organizations)

### The Great Migration
- Over 1 million African Americans moved from the rural South to urban areas in the North
- Reasons: seeking economic opportunities and escaping racial inequities in the South

### Discrimination
- Existed both in the South and the North
- Black World War I veterans faced discrimination after returning from the war
- Defiance and assertiveness contributed to the mood of the Harlem Renaissance
