### [TPO58 L3 Harlem Renaissance](http://top.zhan.com/toefl/listen/intensive.html?appID=63432520%2C2371&backUrl=http%3A%2F%2Ftop.zhan.com%2Ftoefl%2Flisten%2Fjingting58.html)

```

# TPO58 L3
The lecture focuses on the Harlem Renaissance, its significance in the United States culture and history, and its major figures and their works. It also discusses the factors that contributed to the Renaissance and the broader social context of the time.

## Harlem Renaissance
- Literary awakening among African Americans
- Characterized by assertiveness and creativity

### Major Figures
- Langston Hughes
  - Captured African American folk traditions
  - Incorporated blues, jazz, spirituals, and African American musical forms into his poetry
  - First to write a gospel play

- Zora Neale Hurston
  - Celebrated African American folk traditions
  - Published "Their Eyes Were Watching God" in 1937
  - Infused dialect, folklore, and anthropology in her work

### Geographical Scope
- Not limited to Harlem, New York City
- Also occurred in other urban areas (Washington, D.C., Chicago, Cleveland)
- More general term: New Negro Renaissance

### Historical Debate
- Some historians attribute the start of the Harlem Renaissance to movements in the early 1900s
  - W.E.B. DuBois' publication of "The Souls of Black Folks" in 1903
  - DuBois' concept of "double consciousness"
  - The Niagara Movement in 1906 (led to the formation of civil rights organizations)

### The Great Migration
- Over 1 million African Americans moved from the rural South to urban areas in the North
- Reasons: seeking economic opportunities and escaping racial inequities in the South

### Discrimination
- Existed both in the South and the North
- Black World War I veterans faced discrimination after returning from the war
- Defiance and assertiveness contributed to the mood of the Harlem Renaissance

## TPO59 

### [TPO59 L1 Panoroma](https://t.weixue100.com/toefl/listening/61797.html) 

```
# TPO59 European Art Panorama
- The lecture discusses the history and significance of panoramas as a popular 19th-century art form that contributed to the realism movement in European art.

## Robert Barker
- Invented the panorama
- Painted the first official panorama in 1787
- Solved perspective problems in circular paintings
- Recognized the need for a special viewing space and obtained a patent

## Popularity and Expansion
- Panoramas became popular after 1800
- Special buildings were constructed to display them in major cities across Europe and North America

## Artistic Techniques
- Supervised by first-rate artists for faithful reproductions of scenes
- Techniques to intensify the illusion of reality
    - Special lighting effects
    - Hiding edges of the painting
    - Placing plants and trees between the viewer and the painting

## Innovative Perspectives
- Offered a full 360-degree view, often with a bird's-eye or aerial perspective
- Coincided with the debut of hot air balloons and the construction of the first high-rise buildings

## Popular Subjects
- Detailed views of the cities in which panoramas were exhibited
- Familiarity with the scenes was part of the fascination

## Decline in Popularity
- Waned in the second half of the 19th century due to illustrated newspapers and photography
- Many panoramas were painted over, cut up, or sold, leaving few examples to be preserved

### TPO59 L2 Mass Wasting 

```
# TPO59 L2 Mass Wasting
- **Main Idea**: Discussion of mass wasting, particularly creep and solifluction, and their impact on the environment and infrastructure

## Creep
- More common type of mass wasting
- Soil moves slowly downhill due to gravity and water
- *Example*: Curved trees or tilted fences as evidence of creep

### Wet-Dry Cycles
- Occurs in warmer areas
- Wet conditions cause soil to expand, and dry conditions cause it to contract

## Solifluction
- Similar to creep, occurs in permafrost areas
- Soil moves uniformly down the slope as one large mass
- *Example*: Varying rates of solifluction in Spitsbergen, Norway, evidenced by stumps left over from a 1940 era structure

## Building on Slopes
- Not always the best idea
- Slopes can be stabilized in various ways

## Building on Permafrost
- Risky and should be avoided or done carefully
- Structures should be elevated on posts
- *Example*: Improper elevation can cause solifluction to destabilize the ground, leading to slides or flows and related problems
