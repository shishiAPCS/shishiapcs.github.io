I think music education is essential because it’s a good way to relax ourselves and release pressure. As for me, every time I feel bad, I will listen to some music. Then, I become better. Even some <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">crazy </span>people <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">with severe mental health issues </span>can be <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">treat </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">treated </span>by it.

I think it's necessary to learn to <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">play  </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">play </span>musical instruments. There're 2 reasons to support my opinion. First, playing music is a way to express one's feelings, like many famous <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">pianist, </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">pianists, </span>when they feel bad, <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">the </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">they </span>prefer <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">play </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">to play the </span>piano to make themselves become energetic. Second, learning to play musical instruments can improve your artistic skills, such as feeling the same way as the <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">producer </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">composer </span>of a song. 

JoeChenliverpool: Joe 

I strongly agree that learning a musical instrument is of great importance. It not only helps us cultivate patience in our daily lives but also enhances our mental faculties. Mastering an instrument provides us with an additional avenue and numerous advantages for university admission. For example, when I was <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">young. </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">young, </span>I chose the <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">piano.Playing </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">piano. Playing </span>it <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">helps </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">has helped </span>me a <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">lot. Improve </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">lot, it improved </span>my patience. 

sword008625: <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;"></span>

<span style="color:red;font-weight:700;"></span>I agree that learning to play a musical instrument is significant because it can help release our pressure. We have a lot of work <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">everyday </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">every day </span>and we feel tired after hard work. Research shows that playing <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">a </span>musical instrument can relax us efficiently. What is more, we can develop in an all-round way through learning to play an instrument. Only <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">study </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">studying </span>major subjects <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">can not </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">cannot </span>cultivate <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">true </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">truly </span>talented <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">person. </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">individuals. </span>

I think it's essential to learn to play a musical instrument. First, I think it can develop your knowledge and taste of <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">art.Second, </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">art. Second, </span>I think playing <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">a </span>musical instrument is a good way to relax ourselves when we feel stressed, nervous or down.

I agree with the view that music education is important. Because listening to good music could improve our taste <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">of the </span>for beautiful things in life. And it also <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">influence on </span>influences our emotions.
