|Seanna        |Maybe I would choose to live with my friends, because this way I wouldn't feel very lonely. And if we were renting a house, I would save more money and could do other things.

|Fielder       |For me, I choose the place which is not in Bryant. I think maybe, the first reason is, maybe the place is far from the university, but on the way to the university and the place to work, you may have seen some very interesting things and you have never seen. It can wild your sight. The second reason is, if you choose the place which is very small and old, it's not good for your living life. You may have bad living habits.

|Martin        |First of all, I like living alone, so I will choose a second house. In this way, I will have a sense of privacy. I live by myself, and I will be freer than the first one, and I don't have to coordinate with others. I can do what I want without being conflicted. And your roommate may not be so friendly. You may have some conflict with others over the house.

|Kevin         |I think I will choose all the small places. First, I think it is near the place of work or university. So you can use this time to go to work and university.

|Jenny         |I'd like to choose a place that is very large and its brand is new. There are some reasons. Because I think a good environment is very important to yourself and you can have a good environment to live in and to do such as your work or job or homework. On the other hand, although it is very far from my workplace or university, I can choose to get up earlier and that can also help me get a good habit. So, all in all, I think I'd like to choose the large and brand house to live in.                                             |"I would prefer to choose a place that is very large and brand new. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, I believe that having a good environment is crucial for one's well-being, as it can provide a conducive living and working space. Even though this place is far from my workplace or university, I can adjust my schedule by waking up earlier, which can also help me develop a good habit. Ultimately, I believe that the benefits of living in a spacious and modern house outweigh the inconvenience of the distance."                                                                 |
