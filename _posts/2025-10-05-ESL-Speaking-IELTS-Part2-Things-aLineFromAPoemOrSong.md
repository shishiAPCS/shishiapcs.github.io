## 范文
The line I’d like to talk about is **“Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall, Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.”** //  
It’s from the classic **nursery rhyme “Humpty Dumpty,”** / one of those cheerful little songs that almost every parent ends up memorizing. //  

I first came across it when my daughter was around two. / Every morning we would play an album of English nursery songs, / and this rhyme always made her laugh. / Later, when my son was born, / it became part of his daily soundtrack as well, / so I must have heard those lines hundreds of times. //  
Sometimes I’d find myself **humming it unconsciously while doing chores**, / and it became a kind of **background soundtrack** to our family life during those years. //  

What keeps this rhyme in my mind isn’t just its melody / but the **period of life** it represents. / During the pandemic, / our family was confined at home. / We had to plan everything — milk, diapers, even vegetables — for the whole week. / It was exhausting, yet hearing that playful rhyme in the background somehow **softened the tension**. / The fall of Humpty Dumpty reminded me how **fragile and unpredictable** life can be, / and how quickly everything can change. /  
In a strange way, that little rhyme **captured the uncertainty** of those times far better than any adult song or news headline ever could. //  

Looking back, the rhyme has taken on a **deeper meaning**. / It reminds me that no matter how hard we fall, / there’s always a way to **piece ourselves back together** — perhaps not perfectly, but enough to move on. / Whenever life feels overwhelming, / those simple lines **echo in my head**, / bringing back the laughter of my little ones / and reminding me to stay **resilient, hopeful, and grateful** for small, ordinary moments of joy. /  
To me, those nursery lines aren’t childish at all — they’re a **gentle reminder** that **strength often hides in the simplest words** / and that **love can turn even isolation into connection**. //
