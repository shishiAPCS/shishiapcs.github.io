The student in the letter suggests that the university could display the artwork in the lobby at the entrance to the student center. <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">The </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">However, the </span>woman in the listening part <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">doesn‚Äôt </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">doesn't </span>like this idea because, for one thing, she thinks that the place has millions of people passing by, <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">and it‚Äôs </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">but it's </span>way too crowded. <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">So, it‚Äôs </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">So it's </span>not good for appreciating the artwork since people passing by would block the view, and this is going to be distracting. Secondly, she thinks that the natural light from the glass windows of the student center is actually not good for this artwork. If <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">it‚Äôs </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">it's </span>sunny outside, the light would be way too <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">bright; </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">bright, </span>and if <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">it‚Äôs </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">it's </span>cloudy, <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">it‚Äôll </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">it'll </span>be way too dark. <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">So, </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">So </span>she thinks that <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">this </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">the </span>artwork needs some controlled light, like the ones in the museum.

Entertainment merchandising refers to a form of marketing in which the brand or image from one product is also used to sell <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">another </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">another, </span>and it is often used in TV <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">shows </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">shows, </span>especially those associated with children. The professor uses himself and his daughter as examples. First, the professor uses himself as an example. When he was a kid, he really liked a character called Action <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">Hero </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">Hero, </span>and he often watched the shows of Action Hero on TV and played games with his friends. <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">So, </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">So </span>when he saw the Action Hero toy in the store, he <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">also </span>wanted the toy too. The second example is the <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">professor‚Äôs </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">professor's </span>seven-year-old daughter. She also really <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">likes </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">liked </span>watching TV and she <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">owns </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">owned </span>a cute toy doll.

Here are </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">industry. It refers to connecting </span>two <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">examples, </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">goods together and sharing their popularity. The professor gives two examples in the lecture. Firstly, </span>when the professor was a kid, <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">Action Hero </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">an action hero </span>was very famous, and the professor <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">and his friend </span>watched this television show <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">with his friend </span>every <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">week, then </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">week. Then </span>they began seeing <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">these </span>small Action Hero figures in all the <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">stores. It was </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">stores, which </span>also <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">interesting to </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">interested </span>them, so they also liked playing with the toy. <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">¬∂ </span>The second example is about the professor's <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">daughter, she </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">daughter. She </span>also likes watching television and playing with toys, like a cute little baby <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">doll, her </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">doll. Her </span>friends like it too, so they always talk about <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">this </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">it </span>with each <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">other, then </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">other. Then, </span>some weeks ago, there was a program about <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">this, </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">it, and </span>she and her friends were all happy to watch the show.

<span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;"># task3 </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">task 3 </span>

The reading introduces a concept called Entertainment Merchandising. The concept is about a kind of marketing <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">where </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">in which </span>the brand or image from one product is used to sell another related good as well. There are <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">2 </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">two </span>main types of Entertainment Merchandising. One of them is selling toys that look like the <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">character </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">characters </span>in certain <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">movie </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">movies </span>or <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">cartoon. </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">cartoons. </span>For instance, the professor mentions <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">that </span>once there was a movie called <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">Action Hero. The </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">"Action Hero," and the </span>professor and his friends were interested in this movie. <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">Few </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">A few </span>weeks later, he found <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">out </span>that there <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">was a toy about </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">were toys related to </span>the movie <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">appeared in the store. </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">available in stores. </span>Another <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">one </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">type </span>is making TV shows about popular <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">toys, the </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">toys. The </span>professor introduced his daughter and her <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">friends </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">friends, </span>who have a very lovely toy dog. Almost every girl <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">like </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">of </span>his daughter's age <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">will </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">would </span>buy one, and one day his daughter said there <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">will </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">would </span>be a TV show about the dog. <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">So </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">So, </span>of <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">course </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">course, </span>his daughter <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">will </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">would </span>choose to watch it since she really likes the toy dog.

<span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">task 3 </span>

Entertainment Merchandising means that a brand or image from one product can also be used to sell another. The professor illustrates this by giving an example: in the past, when he was a little child, he really liked <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">Action Hero. </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">action hero. </span>So, he watched a lot of programs about the heroes and imagined being a person like that. <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">So, </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">Therefore, </span>when the toys <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">about </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">related to </span>the heroes came out, <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">it was </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">it's </span>natural for him to have the desire to buy the toys. Another example is about his daughter. His daughter really liked a <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">toy--Rosa. And </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">toy named Rosa, and </span>she always played with the <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">toys </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">toy </span>with her friends. So, when the <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">TV </span>programs about Rosa came out, it was also natural for her to watch the programs.

Entertainment merchandising is a marketing practice <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">using </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">that uses </span>the brand or image from one product to sell another. The professor uses two examples to illustrate this practice. The first example is that when he was a kid, his friends and he liked a character named Action <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">Hero </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">Hero, </span>and they always watched the Action Hero program on <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">Television </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">television </span>and played games pretending to be the powerful hero. After <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">a while, </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">some time, </span>they started to see small hero figures in all the stores. They all watched the TV show <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">for </span>so long that it was natural <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">they wanted </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">for them to want </span>to buy the toys. The second example is that his 7-year-old daughter and her friends <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">like </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">liked </span>a cute little baby doll named Rosa. One <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">day </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">day, </span>his daughter told him that a new TV program with Rosa as the main character would <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">be shown </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">air </span>every week. Naturally, she and her friends all started to watch the television <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">show </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">show, </span>which <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">was already popular, </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">became </span>as popular as the toy doll.

The concept of entertainment merchandising is about a plan to sell and connect <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">two </span>goods together and <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">to </span>share their <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">popularity together. </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">popularity. </span>The professor gives the following <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">example </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">examples </span>in the lecture. Firstly, he gives <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">us his self </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">his own </span>experience. When he was young, he liked a hero, and the hero was really popular. <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">There's </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">There was </span>a program and a game about the <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">hero.

They </span>just wanted to <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">imitate the hero's appearance. And secondly, </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">pretend to be like the hero. Secondly, </span>he gives an example of his daughter. When his daughter was young, she liked a character called Spro, and the character was really popular. <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">There's </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">There was </span>a TV program <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">related to the character </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">about the character, </span>and it <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">is </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">was </span>popular too.

For example, in the lecture, the professor loved a hero character and watched the program every week when he was a <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">child. Later, </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">child, and later </span>it became so normal <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">for him </span>to buy <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">the </span>goods <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">of </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">related to </span>the character in <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">stores they saw after he had watched it for a long time.

Also, the show became really <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">popular as </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">popular, just like </span>the toy doll among the children.

Entertainment merchandising is an effective way of marketing in which a brand or an image from one product is used to sell another. <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">And this </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">This </span>is usually used in shows and movies connected with children. For example, when the professor was a <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">kid. He </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">kid, he </span>and his friends really enjoyed a TV character called Action <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">Hero. And </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">Hero, and </span>they played together, pretending to be action heroes. So when action heroes <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">merchandise </span>came out, they all wanted it. Entertainment merchandising markets a new toy with a popular TV show. In another example, <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">The </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">the </span>professor's daughter loves to play with a cute little baby doll <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">called </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">named </span>Rosa.

I disagree with this <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">opinion, </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">opinion that </span>not all children should be required to learn a second language in <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">school, the reason is </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">school because, </span>for most <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">of the people </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">people, </span>they <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">won‚Äôt </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">won't </span>use it anymore after school. <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">¬∂ </span>First, for most people, they <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">won‚Äôt </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">won't </span>leave the country <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">where they are born from because they can‚Äôt go out of their countries due to many reasons.
