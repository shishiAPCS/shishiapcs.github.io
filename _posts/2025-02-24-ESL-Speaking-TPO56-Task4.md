# Task4
## Using the examples from the lecture, explain two ways the railroad system changed business in the United States.


## Listening

Listen to part of a lecture in a history class.  
Okay, so we've been talking about various factors that have changed the United States economy. One especially important factor was the development of railroads.  
When the railroad system expanded throughout most of the United States, it fundamentally changed the way business was done in this country. For one thing, the expansion of railroads enabled companies to start selling their goods all across the country. Since trains could now transport merchandise all over the United States, companies could sell goods to consumers pretty much anywhere.  
For example, there was a big company that sold clocks. The company started in a big city, and before the development of railroads, it could only sell its clocks to people who lived in or near that city. But when the railroads expanded, the company could load its clocks onto trains and have them delivered to all parts of the country.  
Railroads also changed business in the U.S. by making it possible to open factories in new locations. Many factories had machines that were powered by certain raw materials, like coal, and railroads made it possible to transport those raw materials to areas of the country where they weren't found naturally.  
A good example is some factories in the southern United States. In certain parts of the South, there wasn't much naturally occurring coal. So before the expansion of railroads, there weren’t many factories there because there were no raw materials like coal to provide power for the factory machines. But after railroad lines were built in the South, coal could be brought in from other parts of the country, allowing new factories to open there.

Second, many areas in </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>second example is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>U.S. didn’t have factories before </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>US aren't have manufactory before.

<p>In history class, the professor <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>thinks </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>explained that </span>the railroad system <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>changes </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>changed </span>the history of the United States <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>just like the examples given by the professor. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>in significant ways. </span>First, before the United States <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>have the railroad, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>had railroads, </span>some companies <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>can sell good because they sit in the big city, but they can </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>could </span>only sell their <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>products </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>goods </span>in the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>city. When railroad invented, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>city where </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>can </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>were located. However, with the invention of railroads, they could </span>sell their products <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>in </span>all <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>parts of </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>over </span>the country, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>so they can develop </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>which helped them grow </span>their <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>business. And the second one is, railroad makes </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>businesses. Second, railroads made </span>it possible to open factories in <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>some countries, so that they can make their products </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>new locations, allowing them to produce goods </span>more <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>cheap </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>cheaply </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>more quickly, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>quickly </span>because they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>can have </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>could transport raw materials and hire </span>more <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>people to work with them.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>workers.</span></p>

<p>In <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>this </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the </span>lecture, the speaker <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>talked about </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>discussed how </span>the railroad <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>and the first one, the first change is that the first railroad is a, is the campground of </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>system changed business in </span>the United States <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>and when it built completely and it </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>in two main ways. First, the expansion of railroads allowed companies to sell their products across the entire country. For example, a clock company that could only sell locally </span>was <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>very useful for the business because other people as the work of the business will still be </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>now </span>able to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>do their jobs and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>ship its clocks to customers everywhere thanks to </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>single one is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>railroads. Second, railroads enabled factories to open in new locations by transporting raw materials like coal to areas </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>after a few years ago, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>didn't have them. This meant that places </span>in the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>US, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>southern U.S., where coal was scarce, could now have factories because they could get </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>railroad changes and this changes could have a, could be better for the industrial business.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>coal they needed from other regions.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>But sure, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Sure! The professor talked about how </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>professors talk about the various factors that have </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>railroad system </span>changed <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the universe of </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>business in </span>the United States in <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>color and wrong, especially </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>two main ways. First, railroads allowed companies to sell their goods across the entire country. For example, a clock company that started in a big city could only sell to local customers before railroads. But with the railroads, they could ship clocks to people all over the country. </span>

<span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Second, railroads made it possible to open factories in new places. In the South, where there wasn't much coal, railroads helped bring in the raw materials needed </span>for <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>factories. This meant that new factories could open in areas that didn't have </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>fact that it was too developed for </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>resources before. So, railroads really changed how businesses operated in </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>fundamental real world. When the real world seemed expanded throughout each most of the universe these days, it found a mentally-chancellate way of business was down in this country of one thing, the expression of the real world.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>U.S.!</span></p>

<p>The professor discusses two <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>ways, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>ways </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>real-world </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>railroad </span>system <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>changes the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>changed </span>business in the United States. The first way is that the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>real-world </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>railroad </span>system <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>changes the health and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>allowed </span>merchants to sell their products <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>in </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>across </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>whole </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>entire </span>country. For example, the clock <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>company. The clock </span>company <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>can just </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>could only </span>sell <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>its clocks </span>in <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>a small city at first, but with </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>small CD and first, with </span>development of the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>real-world </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>railroad </span>system, it <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>can </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>could now </span>sell <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>their </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>its </span>clocks <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>in the whole country. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>nationwide. </span>The second way is that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>it can help to </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the railroad system helped </span>build <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the </span>industries in <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the country, for example the core industries. At first, it can </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>new areas. For instance, many factories needed raw materials like coal, which were not found in some regions. Before railroads, </span>only <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>a small part of the city can </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>cities with coal could </span>have <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the core industries, but </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>these factories. But </span>with the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>real-world system groups, the whole country can </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>railroad system, coal could be transported to places that didn't </span>have <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the core industries </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>it, allowing new factories </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>have core industries to work.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>open in those areas.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>Professor Expand you a real road </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The railroad </span>system <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>chain, the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>significantly changed </span>business in the United <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>States. The first way is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>States in two main ways. First, it allowed companies </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>develop their real stop. They start starting </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>sell </span>their goods across <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>all </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>counter, for </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>entire country. For </span>example, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>of the big company. They reach sales </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>there was </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>clock. That's the first, they </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>large clock company that could </span>only sell <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the class where they meet nearby. So then they expand the market as well. They can sell the class in all the country, so they can open the company, which allowed more people to buy. They can change business </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>its clocks </span>in the <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>city where it was based. But after the railroads expanded, they could transport their clocks to customers all over the </span>United <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>States.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>States, increasing their market reach. Second, railroads made it possible to open factories in new locations. Many factories needed raw materials like coal to operate, but some regions, like the southern U.S., lacked these materials. With the expansion of railroads, coal could be transported from other areas, enabling new factories to open in the South. This change greatly impacted the business landscape in the country.</span></p>

<p>In the lecture, the professor <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>introduced the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>discussed </span>two ways that the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>real-world </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>railroad </span>system <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>changes the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>changed </span>business in the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>US. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>United States. </span>The first way is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>that it allowed companies to sell their </span>merchandise <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>can be sailed around </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>across </span>the country. For example, there <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>was </span>a company <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>that sold clocks, but before the railroad expansion, </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>sell the clock, but they can </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>could </span>only sell to <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>people in their city. After </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>local people or near the city. The real-world changes the situation. After </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>railroads were built, </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>have the real-world system, they can sell </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>could transport </span>their <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>clock </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>clocks all </span>over the country. The second <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>way </span>is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>about the material raw. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>related to raw materials. </span>Some factories <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>don't </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>didn't </span>have the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>material </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>necessary </span>raw <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>materials </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>support </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>operate </span>their <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>machine.

First, railroads allowed companies to sell their goods all across </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>talk about the... Here is Sim's history </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>country. Before railroads, a company that sold clocks could only reach customers in its city. However, with railroads, they could transport clocks to people all over the nation. Second, railroads made it possible to open factories in new locations. For instance, </span>in the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>different era </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>southern United States, there wasn't much coal naturally available.

Overall, railroads transformed the way businesses operated by expanding their reach </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>way now the freeing thing. We know the difference, I would have a different aspect. So we can really see the link some things.

<p>The <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>expansion of the </span>railroad system <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>expansion </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>dramatically </span>changed <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the </span>business in the United States <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>dramatically because the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>in two main ways. First, it allowed </span>companies <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>can </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>to </span>sell <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>their </span>goods <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>to </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>across </span>the entire <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>countries. The professor gave us two examples. The first one is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>country. For example, a big clock company </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the big company, which sells the clogs, is just can sells the clothing </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>used to sell only </span>in its own <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>cities where they located it. And after </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>city could now ship clocks to customers all over </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>expansion, it can sell to the whole countries, which benefit their </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>nation, greatly increasing its sales and reach. Second, railroads enabled </span>companies <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>a lot. And second is about the US companies. And it's the railroad helped them </span>to transport <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>raw materials more efficiently. In </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>raw materials. There is a coal industries, and because </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>South, </span>there <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is no coal raw materials, it is really harsh for them to be </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>weren't many factories before </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>factories. Because there is no material to support their powers. However, after the raw expansions, it is taken open </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>railroads </span>because they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>can have </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lacked access to coal, a key resource for powering machinery. Once </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>raw material</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>railroads were built, coal could be brought in from other regions, allowing new factories to open and boosting the local economy.</span></p>

<p>In the lecture, <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>it was mentioned that </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lecture have a mention of the two ways. Railroad system, chain </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>railroad system changed </span>business in the United <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>States. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>States in two significant ways. </span>First, <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>railroads allowed companies to sell their goods across the entire country instead of just in their local areas. For example, a clock company that started in a big city could only sell to people nearby. But with the railroads, </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>have a lot of company in </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>could transport their clocks to consumers all over </span>the United States. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>And they </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'></span>

<span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The second way railroads changed business was by enabling factories </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>start selling goods. For example, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>open in new locations. Many factories needed raw materials, like coal, to run their machines. Before </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>call, it's a call. It's </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>railroads, some areas, especially </span>in the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>big city, but it's just a sell people, sell </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>South, didn't have access to coal. But once </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>people that they live </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>railroads were built, coal could be transported from other regions, which allowed new factories to be established </span>in <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>and they are bought. But then they treat it to another country and they can chain goods. The second is the transport material. For example, in the United States, they have a naturally material. It's named the call. And they can provide power for machines.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>those areas.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>I'm going </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The railroad system changed business in the United States in two significant ways. First, it allowed companies </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>start with </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>sell their goods across </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>first one. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. I'm going </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>consumers nationwide. Second, railroads enabled factories </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>pull out this.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>open in new locations by transporting raw materials, like coal, to places where they weren't naturally available. This meant that even areas without local resources could have factories, leading to more industrial growth.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>History </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>In history </span>class, the professor explained <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>to you what is that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>how </span>the railroad system changed business in the United States. The first <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>one </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>way </span>is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>about the transformation between the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>that it transformed how companies operated across </span>different <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>parts of the companies. One good example of that is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>regions. For example, there was </span>a big <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>company, which is sales </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>company that sold </span>clocks. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>And in </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Before the railroads expanded, </span>this <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>example, at first, before the real-waste was calmed, the </span>company <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>can </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>could </span>only <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>sales </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>sell its </span>clocks to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>use </span>people who <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lived </span>near <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>in </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>companies. And when </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>city where it was located. However, once </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>railroad was coming up, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>railroads were developed, </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>can </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>could </span>send <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>their clocks to customers all over </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>clocks into different parts of the company. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>country. </span>The second way is that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>they can </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>railroads made it possible to </span>transport <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>raw </span>materials to <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>factories. For instance, in </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>companies. Like </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>southern United States, there wasn't much coal available naturally. Before </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>codes, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>railroads, there weren’t many factories in that region because </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>can transport it into </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lacked </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>company.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>necessary power sources. But after the railroads were built, coal could be brought in from other areas, allowing new factories to open in the South.</span></p>

<p>The professor gave us two examples <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>to explain two ways in well-roads, statement changes </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>of how the railroad system changed </span>business in the United States. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>And </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The first example is that railroads allowed companies to sell their goods across </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>first one is starting selling group. And it's pretty much </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>country. For instance, a big clock company that started </span>in <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>company. And there are big companies in </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>a city could only sell to people nearby. But with </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>big city. And the second is the railroad in </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>railroads, they could send clocks to customers all over </span>the United States. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>It can create a </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The second example is that railroads helped factories open in </span>new <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>location </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>locations. Many factories needed raw materials like coal to operate, but some areas, especially </span>in the <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>southern </span>United <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>States. And this is a material called cold. And it doesn't, there's not cold in many factories. And this material is a </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>States, didn't have coal. With railroads, coal could be transported from other regions, allowing </span>new <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>thing of machine.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>factories to be established where they weren't possible before.</span></p>

<p>The <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>road </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>railroad system </span>is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>good </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>really important </span>for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the </span>business <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>because the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>because, </span>first, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the people can </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>it allows companies to </span>sell <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>good to </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>their goods </span>all <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>over </span>the country. For example, <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>there was a company that produced clothes, and before the railroads, </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>have the company produced clothes. It's </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>could </span>only sell in <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the </span>big cities. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>So, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>But with </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>road is coming so </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>railroads, </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>can </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>could </span>sell <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>their </span>goods <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>nationwide. Secondly, railroads are crucial for transporting raw materials </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the other country. The next is very good for the transform because </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>areas where they are needed. For instance, </span>some <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>areas </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>places </span>didn't have <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>some material </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>enough coal </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>build </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>power factories, but once </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>machine. And if </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>railroads were built, </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>have the road, they can have a good ways </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>could bring coal from other regions, allowing new factories </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>transform the material to a different area.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>open up.</span></p>

<p>In the lecture, the professor <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>makes an </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>talks about how the railroad system changed business in the United States. One </span>example <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>he gives is </span>about <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the history of </span>a big <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>company, what starts </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>company that started </span>in <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>America, but it's not so good. They </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>a city. Before the railroads, they could </span>only <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>can </span>sell <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>for the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>their clocks to </span>people <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>who live in the city and some visitors who visit here. And </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>nearby. But </span>after the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>railroad system, ZICEM, first ZICEM, we use </span>railroads <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>were built, they could transport their clocks </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>do things </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>customers all over the country, which really expanded their market. The second way railroads changed business is by allowing new factories </span>to <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>open. In some areas, like the southern United States, there wasn't much coal available to power factories. But with the railroads, coal could be brought in from </span>other <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>places </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>places, which allowed factories </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>sell. So, this expands the markets of the company. And the second, the opens a new factory. This also provides a new way to sell the products and the new factory.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>start operating in those regions.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>seshwa whee</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>One way the railroad system changed business in the United States is by allowing companies to sell their goods across the country. For example, a clock company that started in a big city could only sell to local customers before railroads. After the railroads expanded, they could transport clocks to consumers all over the nation. Another way railroads impacted business was by enabling factories to open in new locations. For instance, in the southern United States, there was a lack of coal for powering factories. With railroads, coal could be brought in from other areas, allowing new factories to operate there.</span></p>
