### Topic: Social Issues — Raising the Legal Driving Age

**Question:**
*Some people think that the best way to improve road safety is to increase the minimum legal age for driving a car or motorbike. To what extent do you agree or disagree?*

---

### Sample Answer

I **strongly agree** that **raising the minimum legal driving age** would be an effective measure to improve road safety. While other interventions such as **stricter enforcement** and **better infrastructure** are important, increasing the age at which people can obtain a full licence directly addresses two **root causes** of many collisions: **immature decision-making** and **limited financial preparedness**.

To begin with, **cognitive and emotional maturity** are crucial for safe driving. **Neuroscientific research** shows that the **frontal cortex**—the region responsible for **impulse control**, **planning**, and **risk assessment**—continues to develop into early adulthood. Younger drivers therefore tend to act **more impulsively** and are **more susceptible to peer pressure**, which often translates into **dangerous behaviours** such as **speeding** or **risky overtaking**. For example, **crash statistics consistently show** higher accident rates among 16–19-year-olds than among older age groups. **Delaying full driving privileges** until drivers are older would give individuals more time to **develop sound judgement** and **reduce the incidence of emotion-driven mistakes**.

Furthermore, **financial readiness** affects a driver’s ability to **maintain a safe vehicle** and **obtain adequate insurance**. Many teenagers lack the resources for **routine servicing**, **timely tyre replacement**, or for repairs to **critical components** such as brakes; **deferred maintenance** increases the risk of **mechanical failure** on the road, and **inadequate insurance** leaves victims and public services **shouldering the cost of accidents**. For instance, jurisdictions with higher minimum licensing ages often report **lower rates of uninsured drivers** and **fewer maintenance-related incidents**. Ensuring drivers are older when granted full driving rights therefore reduces both **mechanical risks** and the **social costs of crashes**.

In conclusion, **raising the legal driving age** would enhance road safety by allowing greater **psychological development** and improving **financial responsibility** among drivers. **Paired with graduated licensing** and **driver education**, this measure could **substantially reduce accidents** and their **wider societal impact**.
