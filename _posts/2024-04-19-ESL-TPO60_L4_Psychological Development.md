# Summary of Lecture on Developmental Psychology<br> TPO60_L4_发展心理学讲座摘要

## Principles of Human Development<br> 人类发展原则
- **Definition of Development:** Human development refers to the physical, intellectual, and personality changes that occur from birth to around age 16.<br> **发展的定义：** 人类发展指的是从出生到大约16岁期间发生的身体、智力和个性变化。
  
## Influence of Heredity and Environment<br> 遗传与环境的影响
- **Dual Influence:** Both heredity and environment significantly shape development, though their exact contributions are hard to distinguish.<br> **双重影响：** 遗传和环境都显著地塑造发展，尽管它们的确切贡献难以区分。
  - **Example of Influence:** Genetic traits such as height are influenced by heredity, but environmental factors like nutrition can modify these traits.<br> **影响示例：** 基因特征如身高受遗传影响，但环境因素如营养可以改变这些特征。

## Developmental Rates and Stages<br> 发展速率和阶段
- **Different Rates:** Development occurs at different rates for different physical and mental aspects.<br> **不同的速率：** 不同的身体和心理方面的发展速度不同。
  - **Physical and Mental Development:** An adolescent might appear physically mature but still behave childishly, indicating different developmental rates.<br> **身体和心理发展：** 青少年可能在外表上看起来成熟，但仍然表现出孩子气的行为，这表明发展速率不同。
- **Sequential Development:** Development follows a specific sequence, particularly clear in physical and motor skills.<br> **顺序发展：** 发展遵循特定的序列，尤其在体能和运动技能方面表现得非常清晰。
  - **Stages in Physical Development:** Infants can lift their chin before they can sit up, and they can sit before they can stand.<br> **身体发展阶段：** 婴儿可以在能坐起之前抬头，可以在能站立之前坐着。

## Continuity and Variability<br> 连续性和变异性
- **Continuous Development:** Development is continuous, with overlapping stages making distinct transitions unclear.<br> **持续发展：** 发展是持续的，各个阶段重叠，使得明确的过渡不明显。
  - **Difficulty in Determining Stages:** Child development charts often show age ranges instead of specific months or years due to overlapping developmental stages.<br> **确定阶段的难度：** 由于发展阶段的重叠，儿童发展图表通常显示年龄范围而不是具体的月份或年份。
- **Individual Variability:** There is significant variability in how individuals develop.<br> **个体变异：** 个体发展的方式存在显著的变异性。
