I disagree with this idea for several reasons. Firstly, because of <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">the </span>internet problems, taking online courses can <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">make you have problems. </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">cause issues. </span>For example, in the <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">past I too </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">past, I took </span>an online <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">source </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">course, </span>and my WiFi <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">has </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">had </span>some problems. <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">So, I lose </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">As a result, I lost </span>the chance to discuss a math question with my classmates. Secondly, learning in <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">the </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">a </span>traditional classroom setting can <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">let </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">help </span>you pay full <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">of </span>attention. When I took online classes, I <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">liked to use my phones </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">often found myself using my phone </span>to do something else. But in the traditional classroom, because the teacher can <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">know </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">see </span>what I'm doing, I <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">usually </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">typically </span>just study hard and don't do other things. In general, learning in <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">a </span>traditional classroom setting can make <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">you study </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">your studies </span>more effective.

I disagree with this statement. <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">Because </span>I think there are more interactions in traditional classrooms than in online courses. Students can have discussions and <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">they </span>see each other <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">face to face. Its </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">face-to-face. It's </span>highly probable that some of them will become friends. <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">While in the </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">Meanwhile, in </span>online courses, students don't know each other, <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">they miss </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">missing </span>a chance <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">of making </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">to make </span>friends. Also, if a student doesn't understand an idea, they can raise <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">their </span>hand to ask the teacher directly.

I disagree with this statement. Firstly, some students may <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">do other things </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">engage in activities that </span>don't have <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">a </span>connection with study. For example, when I have online classes, I just <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">cut screen </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">switch screens </span>to play games or talk with my <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">friends, when </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">friends. When the </span>teacher <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">ask </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">asks </span>me <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">to </span>answer <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">a </span>question, I just <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">said </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">say </span>my Wi-Fi is not so <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">good, </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">good and that I </span>can't listen clearly. Secondly, it's difficult for teachers <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">to </span>know <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">students </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">students' </span>conditions clearly. By contrast, in traditional classes, when <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">you think other things </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">you're distracted </span>in class, it's easy for teachers <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">to </span>remind you.

I don't think online courses <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">is </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">are </span>more effective than traditional courses. The first reason is about <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">the </span>active <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">learning, so </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">learning; </span>traditional campus life can benefit a student’s college life <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">is having </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">by providing direct </span>contact with professors and instructors. With online learning, the options are limited. On-campus, students can set up face-to-face meetings with their professors to discuss the class, their performance, or a project. Also, I think not all <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">major </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">majors </span>can be learned online. So, I disagree with this statement.

<span style="color:red;font-weight:700;"></span>I disagree with this statement. The first reason is that if I have a question, in the traditional classroom I can just <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">rise up </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">raise </span>my hand and ask my teachers, like when I am taking <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">a </span>precalculus course and I have some problems that I want to ask my teacher, I can just stand up and ask. Secondly, when taking online <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">courses </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">courses, </span>teachers <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">can not make sure </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">cannot ensure </span>what we are <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">doing, like </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">doing. For instance, </span>during the pandemic, one of my <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">classmate are </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">classmates was </span>playing with his computer and the teacher didn't know that, <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">and that make </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">making </span>the online course less effective than the traditional classroom.

Personally <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">speaking,I </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">speaking, I </span>agree that learning through online courses is more effective than learning in the traditional classroom setting. I have two <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">reasons.First </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">reasons. First </span>of <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">all,study </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">all, studying </span>online is more convenient than the traditional <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">one.For instance,you are willing </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">method. For instance, if you want </span>to research some <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">resourses, </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">resources, </span>you can open your computer and check it directly instead of scanning <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">the </span>paperwork page by <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">page.It </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">page. It </span>really saves <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">time.Secondly,take </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">time. Secondly, taking </span>internet courses <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">help </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">helps </span>train your <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">concentration.For example,teachers </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">concentration. For example, teachers </span>cannot focus on you all the <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">time,you </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">time, so you </span>have to pay attention to the classes if you don't want to <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">lose </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">miss out on </span>some knowledge.

I think studying in traditional classroom settings is more effective than learning through online courses. Firstly, students can solve their problems immediately and effectively. For example, if a student <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">meet </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">encounters </span>difficulties in his assignment, he can ask teachers in the classroom immediately to solve his problem. Secondly, traditional classroom settings provide students a better place for communication. They can discuss with other students and share different opinions. <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">And it will </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">This can </span>be beneficial for their <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">study. So </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">studies. So, </span>I think it is more effective <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">learning </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">to learn </span>in traditional classrooms.

I disagree with this statement. Firstly, I think that <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">the </span>online courses <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">is </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">can </span>harm <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">for </span>students' eyesight and <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">skeleton </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">skeletal </span>structure. <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">Because </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">This is because </span>students need to look at screens and stay <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">on the sit </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">seated </span>for a long <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">time </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">time, sometimes </span>even the <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">whole daytime. But for </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">entire day. However, in </span>the traditional classroom, teachers can supervise students to <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">tell if </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">ensure </span>they are <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">study </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">studying </span>carefully, and students can also have some communication or even debates with <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">teacher </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">teachers </span>and classmates to better understand the knowledge <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">learnt the </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">learned that </span>day. For <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">example that </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">example, </span>if you are <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">having </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">taking </span>online courses, the teacher cannot see your <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">whole </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">entire </span>body through the <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">little </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">small </span>screen.
