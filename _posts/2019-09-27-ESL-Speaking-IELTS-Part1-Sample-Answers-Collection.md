## Home & Accommodation

**Key Vocabulary:** multifunctional space • home office • at the same time • board games • after work • flat layout • family area

**Key Vocabulary:** physically comfortable • boost my efficiency • quiet space • pays off • productivity • invest in comfort

---

### 15\. What’s the difference between where you live now and where you lived before?

Now I live in my **own apartment**, which I bought about seven years ago.

**Key Vocabulary:** my own apartment • small studio • share facilities • other tenants • inconvenient • a huge upgrade

---

### 16\. What kind of home would you like to live in in the future?

---

At first, a **house sounds amazing**—having a garden, a garage, maybe even a pool. But when I think about **maintenance costs** and time, a **flat is much more practical**. You don’t need to **mow the lawn** or **clean a pool**, so it **saves both money and effort**.

**Key Vocabulary:** maintenance costs • practical choice • mow the lawn • clean a pool • saves effort • sounds amazing

---


### 1\. Do you like buying shoes?

**Key Vocabulary:** on sale • shop for fun • care more about • comfort and practicality

---

### 2\. Have you ever bought shoes online?

Yes, quite often. I usually shop on **JD**, one of the biggest **e-commerce platforms** in China. The best thing is the **seven-day free-return policy**—it makes shopping **stress-free**, since I can just **send the shoes back** if the size doesn’t fit.

---

### 3\. Are there rules for students at your school?

---

### 4\. Do you prefer more or fewer rules at school?

**Key Vocabulary:** fewer but clearer rules • simplicity works best • feel controlled • healthy learning environment

---

Got it 👍 I’ll **revise your answers into natural, IELTS-style American English**, clean up the structure, and **match the exact format** you showed (headings, questions, polished answers, and key vocabulary).
I’ll focus on **Part 1 – The Area You Live In**.

---

## Home & Accommodation / The Area You Live In

### 1. Do you like the area you live in?

I wouldn’t say I *love* it, but it’s **pretty decent overall**. The biggest advantage is that it’s very **convenient**—it’s close to the **Second Ring Road**, so transportation is easy. The downside is that it’s **quite noisy** because my apartment is near a **major road**, so traffic can be loud, especially during rush hour.

**Key Vocabulary:** pretty decent • convenient location • major road • downside • traffic noise • rush hour

---

### 2. Where do you like to go in that area?

My favorite place nearby is a **park close to my apartment**. It’s less than a **10-minute walk**, which makes it really convenient. The park is **quiet and peaceful**, with lots of **greenery**, so it’s a great place for me to **relax and clear my mind**.

---

### 3. Do you know any famous people in your area?

**Key Vocabulary:** renovation • exterior wall • brand new • noticeable change • recently

---

### 5. Do you know any of your neighbors?

**Key Vocabulary:** renters • residents • move out • change frequently • get to know

---

### 6. Are the people in your neighborhood friendly?

I’d say people here are **generally polite but distant**. We usually **smile or nod** at each other in the elevator, but we don’t really have conversations. I guess that’s one of the **downsides of city living**—people tend to feel more **isolated**.

**Key Vocabulary:** generally polite • distant • small gestures • downside of city living • isolated

---

### 7. Do you live in a noisy or quiet place?

It’s kind of a **mix of both**. My apartment has four rooms—two of them face the **main road**, so they’re quite noisy, while the other two face the **opposite side** and are much quieter. Overall, it’s **manageable**.

**Key Vocabulary:** mix of both • face the road • noisy vs. quiet • manageable • apartment layout
