# Task1 

I think some <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">people who </span>go to <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">other </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">another </span>country to study choose to live on their own or with <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">a </span>few of their <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">friends </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">friends, which </span>is a better way. Since all my friends are the same age, they will communicate with each other more and won't feel lonely or <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">distant.When </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">distant. When </span>they are in trouble, they can also turn to them for help. But studying abroad to stay with a family already living in the country will make you uncomfortable because it will embarrass you and you will not feel very comfortable because they are your <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">elders.When </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">elders. When </span>you are with your peers, you can share your stories without worry, and you can face difficulties together without feeling <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">helpless, so go </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">helpless. So, going </span>to another country to study <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">choose </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">and choosing </span>to live on <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">their </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">your </span>own or with <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">A </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">a </span>few of <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">their </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">your </span>friends <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">Other students </span>is a good way to do <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">it </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">it. </span>

# Task3 

The behavior of one particular species of ant is a case in point. They have underground nests in the forest. If there are young ants in an ant colony, but there is not enough food in their old place, they will go elsewhere to find food. <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">So </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">So, </span>once the food supply runs out, they move again to another location to make sure they have a constant supply of fresh food. This goes on until the little ants grow up and no longer need as much food. When this happens, community activities can eventually stop moving from place to place and find a new underground den in the forest for the group to stay and live in.

# Task 1 

I think it is better for students who go to study in another country to choose to live on their own or with <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">a </span>few friends. Because independence is an important skill. If you choose to live on your own or live with <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">a </span>few friends, that will help you learn to be independent. However, living with family will be slower or harder to learn to be independent. This independence is very useful when you are working, so I prefer to choose to live on my own or with <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">a </span>few friends. 

# Task 3 

The nomadic phase is a concept that means that certain insects spend time in both extended periods of settlement and extended periods of travel. During a period of travel, the entire group will continually move from one place to another. The professor gave an <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">example, </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">example: </span>ants. Ants live underground, and baby ants need enough food to grow. <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">So </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">So, </span>when the food supply runs out in one place, the ants move on to live somewhere else, and they keep moving until the baby ants grow <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">up.This </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">up. This </span>phenomenon is called the nomadic phase.

I think it's better for students to <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">live with a </span>few of their friends to <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">study.And </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">study. And </span>because <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">first </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">firstly, </span>they have a team working and teach <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">each </span>other and <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">to </span>improve together <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">and to get successful.The second </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">to become successful. Secondly, </span>someone <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">may </span>think living on their own or <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">study </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">studying </span>by <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">their self </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">themselves </span>is <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">boring </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">boring, </span>so they can live and study with others to feel interested in <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">the study </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">studying </span>hard. 

# task3 

They are talking about <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">the insect,spend </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">insects that spend </span>time <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">to travel </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">traveling with </span>their <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">baby to found </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">babies to find an </span>area near the <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">nest.And the food,for example,the </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">nest. For example, the </span>professor <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">has </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">mentioned </span>an ant <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">live </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">that lives </span>together <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">and underground and that </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">underground. Their baby ants live together, and </span>their <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">baby ants live together and their food is come </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">food comes </span>from other strong <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">and </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">ants that </span>bring them <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">food.And the </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">food. The </span>strong ants will carry the baby ants to a new place to find food <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">at </span>every <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">night.And </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">night. And the </span>baby ants want to go eat so much food from <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">the </span>place to place and <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">under the ground. </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">underground. </span>

# task1 

I think it's better for students to live on their own or with <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">a </span>few of their friends. Because it will make students become more <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">imdependent. </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">independent. </span>If students live with their family, they won't become more independent. So I think it's better for students to live on their own or with <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">a </span>few of their friends. 

# task3 

The example from the professor's lecture illustrates <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">the </span>nomadic <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">plase </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">phase </span>by pointing out that a nomadic <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">plase </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">phase </span>may begin because a group of <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">inserts </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">insects </span>has a temporary need for additional <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">resourses </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">resources </span>that can't be found in the area near the nest. So the group must travel in search of these <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">countries. </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">resources. </span>

# Task1 

Living on their own or with a few friends and staying with a host family are both viable options for students who study abroad. Living independently can provide students with a sense of freedom and the opportunity to develop essential life skills, such as budgeting and cooking. Living with friends can also foster a sense of community and support. On the other hand, staying with a host family can provide a more immersive cultural experience, allowing students to learn the language and customs more quickly and form close relationships with the host family. Host families can also offer practical support and guidance. 

# Task3 

<span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">Nomadic </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">The nomadic </span>phase means that the entire group of certain insects will continually move from one place to another during a period of travel. 

The professor used a particular kind of ant as an example. These ants live together in colonies <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">or </span>and communities underground. They have underground nests in the <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">forest </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">forest, </span>and much of their life is made up of collecting food, finding food near the <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">nest and bring </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">nest, and bringing </span>it back to the colony. 

<span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">Now </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">Now, </span>when there are baby ants in the colony, <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">the </span>food will <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">not </span>be <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">not </span>enough in that one location. Baby ants require a lot of nutrition, more food than can be found by just searching around near the underground nest. This means <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">the </span>colony needs to do something about this to make sure the baby ants have enough food to grow. What they will do is that the entire colony will leave the nest. They will pick up the baby ants and carry them along to a new location to find a new food supply. And once that food supply runs out, they move again to another location to ensure they have a continual fresh food supply. They often move every night to satisfy the demanding nutritional needs of the baby ants. And this goes on until eventually the baby ants grow and no longer <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">needs </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">need </span>so much food. When this happens, the community events can finally stop moving from place to place and find a spot in the forest to make a new underground nest for the group to stay in and live.

# Task 1 

I prefer <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">the </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">to </span>stay with my family. I don't consider the money for the house and some other things. And I don't consider <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">to fit </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">fitting </span>in the new environment and <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">to get </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">making </span>new friends. <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">if </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">If </span>I face some <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">problem, </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">problems, </span>I can call my family or friend to help <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">me. Because </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">me because </span>they're not so far away <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">to </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">from </span>me. It's <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">a </span>more <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">convenience to </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">convenient for </span>me. 

# Task 2 

The <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">nomadic phase is a behavior during travel, and an insect continues to travel from </span>one <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">kind of insects and ten extend period of on settlement and the some intend period of the insects </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">place to another. The professor gave an example: ants. Ants live together and live in the underground. When ants are babies, mature ants need to collect food to feed the newborn ants to ensure that the little ants have enough food to eat. Adult ants need to </span>go <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">out the settlement </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">to a new place </span>to find <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">the food. That called </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">food for the little ants. In order to feed their next generation, this continuous behavior is also known as the </span>nomadic phase. <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">And if some insects stay the one settlement long time,they cannot find the food in the area near the nest, so they are movement the other places to find the resources. The professor is an example, the an ants of the living in the underground nest, the adult ants will go out the nest to find food for the baby ant have the enough food. </span>

# Task 1 

I prefer to choose to live on <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">their </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">my </span>own or with <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">a </span>few of <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">their </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">my </span>friends when students want to go to <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">anther </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">another </span>country. <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">¶ </span>Firstly, it can help students <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">to </span>develop their friendship. Students need to consider <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">other feelings </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">other's feelings, </span>and they can understand others deeply. <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">¶ </span>Secondly, it can help students become more independent. When students face everything <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">on abroad </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">abroad, </span>they need to solve problems by themselves. 

# Task 3 

Nomadic phase is a behavior during <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">a period of travel, </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">travel when </span>a kind of insect will continue to travel from <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">a </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">one </span>place to <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">another place. ¶ </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">another. </span>The professor gives an example <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">for </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">of </span>ants. Ants <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">are </span>live together and live in the underground. When ants are babies, mature ants need to collect food <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">to baby ants. </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">and feed the newborn ants to ensure that the little ants have enough food to eat. </span>In order to <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">make sure baby ants have enough food to eat, mature ants </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">feed their next generation, they </span>need to go to a new location to find food <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">to baby </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">for the little </span>ants. <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">Even, ants will move to a new place to make baby ants have enough food every night. </span>This behavior <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">will continue </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">continues </span>until <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">baby </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">the little </span>ants grow to <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">the </span>mature ants.

# Task1 

I think it's better to choose a family that already <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">live </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">lives </span>in the country. Because when you arrive in a new country, there are many things you don't know, such as transportation, food, climate, and so on. If you live alone, you won't be able to acquire <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">these </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">this </span>knowledge, but if you live <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">in </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">with </span>a family in that country, you can better adapt to life here and learn <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">better.Moreover, </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">better. Moreover, </span>when you live <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">in </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">with </span>a family in that country, the people you come into contact with will also change, so you <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">also  </span>can <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">also </span>make more <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">friends </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">friends. </span>

# Task3 

In the lecture, the professor gave the following two examples. Firstly, ants spend most of their life collecting food and bringing it back to their nests. Secondly, when there are small ants among the ants and there is not enough food, they will take the small ants and all the ants away and take them to a new place until the food in that place is also eaten up.

# Task1 

I think <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">the </span>students should go <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">aboard </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">abroad, </span>and they prefer to stay <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">at </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">with </span>a family <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">has </span>that already <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">living </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">lives </span>in the country because that is better for the <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">student. </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">students. </span>Because when they <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">feed me </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">face </span>some inconveniences or <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">the </span>things <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">that doesn't understand </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">they don't understand, </span>like how to <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">really </span>install this kind of WiFi connection or where <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">they </span>can <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">I </span>call <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">this the delivery. This kind of </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">for delivery, these </span>basic living things they can learn or they can <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">kind of they can </span>ask someone <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">to ask about them being lost it like </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">for help if they are </span>living <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">on themselves </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">with a family </span>or <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">living with the </span>friends who <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">I knew here. </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">are already there. </span>

# Task3 

The reading passage introduces a term called Nomadic Phase, meaning a temporary <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">time </span>period when the entire group of ants continually <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">travel </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">travels </span>from one place to another in search of additional resources. In the biology <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">lecture </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">lecture, </span>the professor used an example of <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">a </span>particular ant to explain this concept. These ants live <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">in underground colonies in the forest and their entire life is like collecting food and bringing the food to their colony. So when </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">together underground. When there are </span>baby ants in the <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">group may not </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">group, the ants need to collect food for them. In order to ensure that the baby ants </span>have enough food <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">the entire ants colony will start this Nomadic Phase. like they may leave their nest and carry </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">to eat, the mature ants need to go to a new location to find food for </span>the baby <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">ants along with them to </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">ants. They even move to a </span>new <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">locations to ensure that </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">place every night to make sure </span>the baby ants <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">can </span>have <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">a continual fresh food supply to grow. And this situation </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">enough food. This behavior </span>continues until the <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">little </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">baby </span>ants grow up and no longer need so much food.

<span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">i think  </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">I think </span>living with local families is definitely better because students are able to learn so many <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">thing  </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">things in </span>an easier <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">way..It </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">way. It </span>enables them not only to get familiar with the local customs <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">quickly, </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">quickly </span>but also to adapt to the new <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">life  </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">life in </span>a comparatively short time. After all, when those students get enrolled, there are many academic tasks to deal <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">with </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">with, </span>and their time is more suitable for spending on academic research.

Nomadic phase refers to a period of travel when certain insects have to move <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">based </span>on the <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">basis of </span>need for additional resources that cannot be found in the area near the <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">nest.such as, </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">nest.

# Task1 

I think we should be closer to the local residents and participate in <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">the study </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">studying </span>abroad in the way of living with <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">them, </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">them </span>so that we can exercise our oral English ability and <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">have an </span>in-depth understanding of the local culture. At the same time, it can save living expenses without worrying about living <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">arrangements and living. </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">arrangements. </span>Being able to adapt to life quickly will be a good way to live in this situation. 

# Task2 

The nomadic <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">stage </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">phase </span>is a behavior during travel, and an insect continues to travel from one place to <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">another.The </span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">another. The </span>professor gave the example of ants. Ants live in groups underground. When the ants are just born, other ants need to be mothers to collect food and feed the newborn ants to ensure that the little ants have enough food to eat. Adult ants need to go to a new place to find food for the little ants. In order to feed their next generation, such continuous behavior is also known as the nomadic <span style="color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;">stage.</span><span style="color:red;font-weight:700;">phase.</span>
