# Part 2

## 有很多树的地方
Describe a place with a lot of trees that you would like to visit(e.g.a forest,oasis)
You should say:
Where it is
How you knew this place
What it is like
And explain why you would like to visit it

## 范文
The place I’d like to visit is a **botanic garden** / on the **northern edge of Chengdu**, // about **ten kilometers** from where I live. / I first **heard about it** through a **WeChat post**, / and then I **fell down a rabbit hole** of short videos on the platform. // What instantly caught my attention was its **collection of multi-grafted fruit trees**—single trees that **bear two varieties** of **stone fruit**, / such as **peaches and plums** on **one trunk**. //

From what I’ve seen, the garden is **well laid-out**, / with **shaded paths**, **labelled specimens**, / and entire sections devoted to **rare cultivars** that are **hard to find** outside Sichuan. // It’s not a **wilderness**; / it’s a place where **careful curation** and **hands-on horticulture** are **on full display**. //

My reason for going is personal. / When I was a kid, my grandpa taught me how to **graft**—how to **align the scion**, **secure the union**, / and then **wait it out**. / Some attempts **didn’t take**, / and he showed me how to **keep a log**, **track new buds**, / and **learn from failure**. // He was **resourceful** / and believed that if you **make the most of what you have** and **keep trying new approaches**, / you can work through almost any problem. // That **mindset**—**use what you have**, **adjust**, and **try again**—has **stuck with me** / and shaped me into a **more dedicated** learner. //

So I’d like to visit this garden / to **soak in the fragrance of the trees**, / **see the craft up close**, / and **connect the dots** between what I learned in childhood / and what these gardeners practice every day. // I have a feeling that an hour there would **clear my head**, **spark new ideas**, / and **bring back** the quiet encouragement I associate with my grandfather. //
