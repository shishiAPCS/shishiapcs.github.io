# Task3
## Explain what is meant by the paradox of choice, using the example mentioned by the professor.


## Reading

### Paradox of Choice 
The freedom to make choices and decisions makes people happy because it gives them a sense of being in control of their lives.However, the fact that having some choice is good does not mean that having more choice is necessarily better, since having too many choices can cause anxiety and dissatisfaction.The main reason for this is that as the number of options available to us increases, the effort required to make a good decision increases as well. This phenomenon has been termed the paradox of choice:we like having choices and think that having more choices should please us, but instead, it causes us distress.

## Listening

Now listen to a lecture on this topic in a psychology class. Okay, here's an example. Last week I went shopping for a pair of jeans. I hadn't bought jeans in years, and boy, was I in for a surprise. You see, all I wanted was regular jeans. But when I told this to the salesperson, he looked at me as though I were from Mars. He explained that I could choose between five different styles—straight, baggy, and I don't know what else—and a dozen colors. And on top of that, did I want buttons or a zipper?  
Now, it used to be there were only a couple of jean types, and it was easy for me to decide what I wanted. Now, with all these different possibilities, shopping was hard. I went back and forth. This pair was really comfortable, but this other one was the most fashionable. And there were at least four different colors that looked really good.  
Finally, I did settle on one. But what used to take five minutes had turned into a two-hour project. Before, the choice was basically dark blue or light blue, period. Maybe the fit wasn't perfect, but deciding was easy. But now, I had a complex and time-consuming problem on my hands. Plus, all the back and forth actually gave me a headache. Was I making the right decision? How could I be sure? It was only a pair of jeans, but I left the store anxious rather than satisfied with my purchase.

<p>The paradox of choice <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is when there are two </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>refers to the idea that having too </span>many <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>choices </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>options can make it difficult </span>for people <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>it will be. It will be difficult for him </span>to make <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the choice. The example is when man, he just wants </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>decisions. For example, a man goes to a store wanting </span>to buy a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>normal change in </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>simple pair of jeans. In </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>store but when he arrives the store </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>past, </span>there <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>are many types and many styles and colors. So it's very difficult for him to choose which genes he really wants to take. There are </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>were </span>only one or two styles <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>in </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>to choose from, and it would take him just five minutes to decide. However, when he arrives at </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>past </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>store now, he finds many different styles, colors, </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>in the past </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>options, which makes </span>it <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>only takes five minutes. Now </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>much harder for him to choose. Instead of feeling satisfied, </span>he <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>needs to spend </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>ends up spending </span>two hours <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>trying </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>choose </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>decide </span>which <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>genes he wants. So this is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>jeans to buy. This illustrates </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>pattern.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>paradox of choice, where more options lead to more anxiety rather than happiness.</span></p>

<p>The paradox of choice <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>means </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>refers to the idea that </span>when people <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>are making decision if there are </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>have </span>too many options <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>available, people may get stressful </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>to choose from, it can lead to stress </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>not </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>dissatisfaction with their decisions. For example, the professor mentioned going shopping for jeans. In the past, there were only a couple of styles to choose from, which made deciding easy. However, this time, the professor faced five different styles and many colors, which turned a simple decision into a complicated and time-consuming process. What used to take just five minutes ended up taking two hours, which shows how overwhelming too many choices can be. Instead of feeling </span>satisfied with <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>their choice. An example is when professor, when shopping last week for Jin, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the purchase, </span>the professor <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>was told that there are five styles of Jin, and it is easy to make decision in </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>left </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>past because there are only couple of Jin, for professor to choice, but making decision becomes hard now. And a five minutes project can be two hours, so it is more complex for people to make decisions when there are too many options.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>store feeling anxious.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>you you</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>I think the paradox of choice means that while having options is good, having too many can actually make us feel overwhelmed and anxious.

There were different styles, colors, and features </span>to choose <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>one genes but when she lived she finds this genes she's not, she's really wanted </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>from. This made the decision process much harder and took a lot of time. Instead of feeling happy with his choice, he ended up feeling anxious and unsatisfied after spending so much time deciding. So, while choices are nice, too many can make it difficult </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>have. So that she fails the unsatisfactory facts and</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>be happy with our decisions.</span></p>

<p>The paradox of choice <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>refers to the idea that while people enjoy having options, having too many choices can actually lead to confusion and anxiety. For example, the professor shared </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>phenomenon </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>story about shopping for jeans. He used to find it easy to choose between just a couple of options. However, when he went shopping recently, he faced so many styles and colors </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>people like having choice </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>deciding became overwhelming. He felt confused about which jeans to choose because he had to consider comfort </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the thing that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>fashion, turning a simple task into a stressful experience. This shows how </span>having more choices <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>will be more of a choice. Instead, it's because of these terms. And just like the example of a professor, a professor is that a sense of an express cloud last week, we go into it. We're in the same thing. And he told to sell that and the substitute be playing five different choices. And he's very confused that which one he will choose. Like this one is more comfortable, one is fashionable. So in this way.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>can sometimes make us less satisfied.</span></p>

<p>The paradox of choice <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is a phenomenon which describes </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>refers to the idea </span>that <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>while having </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>public they were very happy because they have a </span>freedom to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>decide something. However, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>make choices makes </span>people <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>were also stressed for their suffer from to have </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>happy, having </span>too many <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>decisions </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>options can actually lead </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>decide. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>stress and anxiety. </span>In the professor's example, <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>he went shopping for jeans after a long time and was surprised by </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>professor's one's go to the shopping market to buy </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>many choices available. Instead of just </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>child and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>couple of styles, </span>he <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>asks the salesperson, salesman to have a jeans.

And then </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>two-hour ordeal. Ultimately, he left </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>professor felt that the shopping is hard because he need to design so much choice, decide too many choices. So he finally get a choice. However, it takes him two hours, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>store feeling anxious </span>rather than <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>five minutes.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>satisfied with his purchase.</span></p>

<p><strong>Lauren</strong></p>
<p>The <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>clothes is about the last week, Professor went to a clothes shop and the clothes shop has manning toys for the clothes, then before. So the professor, he feels stressful because he has too much choice. So he needs to, for example, he needs to choose bright blue or the light blue. So he, he feel is difficult for him to make choice. So he finally, he choose, choose clothes and finally, he feels stressful. And this is a </span>paradox of choice <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>refers to the idea that while having some choices can make us happy, having too many choices can actually lead to stress and anxiety. For example, last week, the professor went shopping for jeans after a long time. He expected it to be a quick decision, but </span>when <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>he got to </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>people need </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>store, he found so many options—different styles and colors—that it became overwhelming. Instead of just choosing between dark blue and light blue, he had to think about comfort, fashion, and multiple colors. This made what used to be a simple decision turn into a two-hour ordeal, leaving him feeling anxious rather than satisfied. This illustrates the paradox of choice: </span>too <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>much choice. They will feel stressful </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>many options can make it harder to choose and lead to stress </span>instead <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>of, it's all good for good things for them.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>of happiness.</span></p>

In </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>notice that it's something that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>end, I left </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>freedom choice or decisions </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>store feeling anxious rather than satisfied, which shows how too many choices </span>can be <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the real peace and the first thing I want to tell you about in Southeast. One day she had to go to the store and get </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>boy and that's very funny. She asked if they all know what to buy the Z-Pro button. So it's difficult to choose. And just for the her dad's after choice, sometimes they do choose to go to the choices that they need the happy birthday for. And outside they have the pain to lose show. That's simply what to do show details. The problem about the paradigm of choice and this is part of the choice.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>problem.</span></p>

<p>People <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>are </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>generally feel </span>happy <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>to make </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>when they have </span>some <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>choice </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>choices </span>because <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>that makes people feel some </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>it gives them a </span>sense of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>control. But </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>control over their lives. However, having </span>too many <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>choice </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>choices </span>can <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>also make people feel with satisfaction as XT because if you want </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lead </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>make a good choice, you also need more efforts to intellectual </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>dissatisfaction and anxiety. For example, </span>the professor <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>who is all experienced </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>shared a story about shopping for jeans. He mentioned that he wanted to buy regular jeans, but when he got to the store, he faced too many options—different styles like straight and baggy, </span>as <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>examples. He was buying a jeans but there are two </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>well as </span>many <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>styles, baggy words themselves. There are also many colors so it's hard to, it's </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>colors. This made it </span>hard for <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>him to decide. What used to take him just five minutes turned into a two-hour process. Instead of feeling satisfied with his purchase, he left </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>professor to decide.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>store feeling anxious. This illustrates the paradox of choice: more options can complicate decision-making rather than make it easier.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>According to the article, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The </span>paradox of choice <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>refers to the phenomena </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>means </span>that when <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>people have too many options, they can actually feel anxious and overwhelmed instead of happy. For example, </span>the <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>professor talked about shopping for jeans. He just wanted a regular pair, but the salesperson offered him five different styles, like straight and baggy, and many colors to choose from. Because of all these </span>choices, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>a number of choices that increased, people will feel </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the professor felt </span>nervous and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>anxious when they are making choices because they are worrying about once choice is the best. And the professor offers a good example about it. Now, he was talking about genes. First of all, he just wants some wants a regular ones. But the boss of the shop have offered five choices for him, which has aspects of strength or badging, have bottom or sleeper, and the color is also the option. So the professor feels very nervous and uses </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>spent </span>two hours <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>shopping instead of just five minutes. He was worried about making the best choice, which made the experience stressful </span>rather than <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>just five minutes to shop because he cannot make a good choice.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>enjoyable.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The paradox of </span>choice is a psychological <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>term, means </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>concept </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>when people are facing multiple choices, it wants necessary better </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>suggests having too many options can actually lead to more anxiety </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>it would make much distress and excite his footing. In this </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>dissatisfaction. For </span>example, the professor <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>mentions that he is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>shared his experience shopping for jeans. He just wanted </span>a regular <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>gene </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>pair, but when he went to the store, he was overwhelmed by all the choices—different styles, colors, </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>this professor, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>fits. What used to take him just </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>bit </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>few minutes turned into a two-hour ordeal because he felt stressed about making the right decision.

This shows that while having </span>choices <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>to gain different colors. This way, he does not have time and he needs to care what </span>is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>light one or dark one.
