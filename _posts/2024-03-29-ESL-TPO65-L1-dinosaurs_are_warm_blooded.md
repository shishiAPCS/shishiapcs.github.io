# 恐龙：温血还是冷血？<br> Dinosaurs: Warm-Blooded or Cold-Blooded?

## 历史观点<br> Historical Perspective
- 30年前，普遍认为恐龙是像爬行动物那样的冷血生物。<br> 30 years ago, the consensus was that dinosaurs were cold-blooded, similar to reptiles.
- 近30年来，一些科学家开始提出恐龙实际上可能是温血的。<br> In the past 30 years, some scientists started suggesting that dinosaurs might have been warm-blooded.

## 定义<br> Definitions
- **温血动物**通过自己的新陈代谢产生热量，维持相对较高且通常恒定的体温。<br> **Warm-blooded animals** generate their own heat to maintain a constant body temperature through metabolism.
- **冷血动物**主要依靠环境来调节体温，体温会随着周围温度的变化而大幅度变化。<br> **Cold-blooded animals** rely primarily on the environment to regulate their body temperature, which can vary significantly with the surrounding temperature.

## 支持恐龙是温血的证据<br> Evidence Supporting Warm-Blooded Dinosaurs
- **羽毛**：某些恐龙化石显示有羽毛，类似鸟类，羽毛可能用于隔热。<br> **Feathers**: Some dinosaur fossils show feathers, similar to birds, possibly for insulation.
- **寒冷气候生存能力**：一些恐龙化石在今天具有极地气候的纬度被发现，暗示它们能在寒冷环境中生存。<br> **Ability to Survive in Cold Climates**: Fossils of some dinosaurs have been found in latitudes that have arctic climates today, suggesting they could survive in cold environments.
- **直立姿势**：一些恐龙具有直立姿势，这在现今温血动物中较为常见，如某些灵长类动物和鸟类。<br> **Upright Posture**: Some dinosaurs had an upright posture, which is more common among modern warm-blooded animals, such as some primates and birds.

## 反对恐龙是温血的证据<br> Evidence Against Warm-Blooded Dinosaurs
- **缺乏呼吸性鼻甲**：恐龙缺乏这种在现存温血动物中普遍存在的结构，这种结构帮助预热吸入的空气，防止冷空气直接冲击肺部。<br> **Lack of Respiratory Turbinate**: Dinosaurs lacked this complex structure found in the nasal cavity of existing warm-blooded animals, which helps warm the air breathed in, preventing cold air from shocking the lungs directly.

## 结论<br> Conclusion
- 尽管有间接证据表明恐龙可能是温血的，但它们缺乏对温血动物至关重要的呼吸性鼻甲，这对支持恐龙是温血的理论构成了重大挑战。<br> While there is indirect evidence suggesting dinosaurs might have been warm-blooded, the absence of respiratory turbinate poses a significant challenge to this theory.
