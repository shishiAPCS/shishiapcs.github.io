## 动态线图-旅游信息办公室咨询

The line graph illustrates the number of inquiries received by a city’s Tourist Information Office through three different channels—**in person**, **by telephone**, and **by letter or email**—between January and June 2011.

**Overall**, the total number of inquiries increased over the six-month period, mainly driven by a sharp rise in face-to-face and telephone contacts, while written correspondence declined steadily.

At the beginning of the year, around **900 inquiries were made by telephone**, followed by **about 800 by letter or email**, and **only 400 in person**. From February onwards, in-person visits grew rapidly, overtaking the other two categories by March and reaching **1,800 in June**, more than four times its January level.

Telephone inquiries fluctuated slightly in the first three months, falling to **800 in February** before climbing steadily to **1,600 by June**. In contrast, letters and emails followed the opposite trend: they **fell gradually** from around **800 in January** to **just over 300 by June**, making it the least common mode of inquiry at the end of the period.

**In summary**, tourists increasingly preferred direct and immediate communication, while traditional written correspondence became far less popular.
