# TPO66_L1_sleep<br>## TPO66_L1_睡眠
### Introduction<br>### 引言
- Sleep is not unconsciousness but reduced awareness.<br>- 睡眠不是无意识，而是对周围环境的感知能力降低。
- In the wild, this makes animals vulnerable to predators.<br>- 在野外，这使动物容易受到捕食者的攻击。

### The Biology of Sleep<br>### 睡眠的生物学
- Sleep is risky and must offer significant benefits to have evolved.<br>- 睡眠是一种冒险行为，必须提供显著的好处才能进化。
- Difference between sleep and rest: sleep involves changes in brain activity and disconnection from sensory and motor functions.<br>- 睡眠和休息的区别：睡眠涉及大脑活动的变化和与感官及运动功能的断开。
- Most mammals and birds sleep, but there are exceptions with unusual sleep patterns, like dolphins.<br>- 大多数哺乳动物和鸟类都会睡眠，但也有例外，如具有不寻常睡眠模式的海豚。

### Unusual Sleep Patterns<br>### 不寻常的睡眠模式
- Dolphins sleep one hemisphere at a time, allowing them to swim up for air.<br>- 海豚一次只睡半脑，这使它们能游上水面呼吸。
- This adaptation is identified through measuring brain activity.<br>- 通过测量大脑活动来识别这种适应性。

### Function of Sleep<br>### 睡眠的功能
- Sleep's primary function is not physical rest but benefits the brain.<br>- 睡眠的主要功能不是身体休息，而是对大脑有益。
- Hypothesis: sleep replenishes essential molecules for brain function, like glycogen and neurotransmitters.<br>- 假说：睡眠补充大脑功能所需的重要分子，如糖原和神经递质。
- Sleep contributes to feeling alert and mentally refreshed.<br>- 睡眠有助于感到警觉和精神焕发。

### Individual Differences in Peak Mental Activity<br>### 个体在精神活动高峰的差异
- Not everyone is at their best in the morning; peak mental activities vary.<br>- 不是每个人早上都表现最好；精神活动高峰各不相同。
- Sleep replenishment is crucial for maintaining high levels of mental activity.<br>- 睡眠补给对于维持高水平的精神活动至关重要。
- Sleep and daily mental activity rhythms are independent but interconnected.<br>- 睡眠和日常精神活动节奏是独立的，但相互连接。
