University to Create a Lounge for Commuter Students
Many students at our university do not live in dormitories. These students live in town or in the suburbs and travel to campus every day The university has decided to provide these commuter students with a special lounge in the student center - with couches, chairs, and a television. University officials hope that this lounge - a place to socialize and relax - will give commuter students some of the same advantages that dormitory residents now have. An important additional feature of the lounge will be a bulletin board on the wall for posting and sharing information that may be especially useful to commuter students and their particular needs.

```

## Listening
```
Narrator: Now listen to two students discussing the article. Woman: Hey, it's nice that they're gonna do this. Man: It's not a bad idea, but do you think it will accomplish what they're hoping? Woman: Sure, I mean, the dormitories all have their own lounges, and think about how much time students spent there and how many people they meet. Man: Yeah, I got to know a lot of people in my dorm during my first semester, just watching TV and taking study breaks in the lounge. Woman: Right. Those dorm lounges are really central to student life. and I met people there that really helped me with my schoolwork, too. Students who live off campus don't have anything like that. Man: That's true. Woman: Plus, I like the idea of posting stuff. You know, things like notices from students who want to get together with other students to share car rides to campus. Man: Yeah, ride share information could be helpful. Woman: Absolutely. If students knew about ride shares, they could save money getting to campus, 'cause a few of them could travel in one car.

She thinks they </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>plan because she believes it will facilitate sharing important information, such as ride share options, which </span>can <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>share the right information, the right information is helpful and they can </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>help students </span>save <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>their </span>money <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>to get a compass and travel by car.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>on transportation.</span></p><hr><p>Richard</p><p>The <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>university's </span>plan <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is about building </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>involves creating </span>lounges for students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>who </span>live <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>out of the campus in order for them </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>off-campus </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>do their schoolwork </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>study </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>relaxing. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>relax. </span>The woman <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>thinks it's a good idea </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>believes this is beneficial </span>because <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the man said that the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>dormitory lounges serve as </span>central <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>place </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>places </span>for students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>living in dormitories are mainly for relaxing </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>to socialize </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>do schoolwork and the woman thinks the post is also good because students in the lounge can build up a relationship </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>study, fostering relationships </span>that can <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>share car ride, prevent from driving car individually </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lead to carpooling </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>save money.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>cost-saving opportunities.</span></p><hr><p>Kevin</p><p>The university is planning to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>give </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>create a lounge for </span>students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>living around campus a place to have </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>who live off-campus, offering </span>chairs, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>televisions </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>televisions, </span>and a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>wall to post their things. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>bulletin board for posting information. </span>The <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>girl thing is really nice and a really good idea because there are many students who spend a lot of time watching television and doing their things together. She thinks </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>woman in the conversation believes </span>this is a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>really good place </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>positive </span>and <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>beneficial idea because it will provide </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>good way </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>space for students </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>solve this problem. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>socialize and relax, similar to dormitory residents. </span>She <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>also says </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>mentions how important lounges are for meeting people and getting academic help, emphasizing </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>wall is really good because they don't </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>need for off-campus students to </span>have a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>place to post their things. This </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>similar space. Additionally, she highlights the bulletin board as a valuable resource for sharing information like ride shares, which </span>can <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>also </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>help students </span>save money <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>because the students can travel in one car.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>on transportation.</span></p><hr><p>Seanna</p><hr>
    
<p>Flora</p><p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>Well, the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The </span>university <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>started and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>has </span>decided to create a lounge for commuter students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>because it can give the same </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>to provide them with similar </span>advantages that dormitory residents <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>now have and it's really useful. And the women </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>have. The woman </span>in the conversation <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>think it's </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>finds this plan </span>nice because dormitory <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>now have many students and they </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lounges </span>are essential to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>students' life. And secondly, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>student life, where students can socialize and relax. Additionally, </span>she <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>really likes </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>appreciates </span>the idea of posting <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>stuff because if </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>information, such as ride-sharing opportunities, which can help </span>students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>know </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>save money on transportation </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>share the car ride to the campus, they can save a lot of money and they can just go to the campus and share by only one ride.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>campus.</span></p><hr><p>Wendy</p><p>She <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>thinks this </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>believes the university's </span>plan is not <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>very bad, and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>bad at all; in fact, </span>she <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>thinks it's </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>finds it to be </span>a nice <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>idea, because this </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>idea. The </span>plan <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>helps </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>aims to assist </span>students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>save </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>in saving </span>money <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>on transportation to school, as cars can be quite costly. Additionally, she views it as beneficial since it provides a space </span>for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>transfer </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>students </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>schools. You know, cars are very expensive. And she thinks it's a good idea, because she thinks CAPSOS gives a place that can develop the students' </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>foster </span>relationships and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>can make the students more helpful. It can centralize people's lives, you know, have some </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>offer assistance to one another. This centralized location, equipped with </span>televisions and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>give some funding place to make students relax. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>comfortable seating, serves as a relaxation spot. </span>She <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>thinks it's </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>perceives it as </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>very personal idea, but students think CAPSOS needs to think </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>personalized concept, emphasizing the importance </span>of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the spend </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>spending </span>time and <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>meeting new </span>people <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>they can meet.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>at CAPSOS.</span></p><hr><p>Wesley</p><p>Our <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>school will build </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>university plans to create </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>luggage </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lounge </span>for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the community </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>commuter </span>students to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>have a relaxed time at the campus </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>relax on campus, equipped with chairs </span>and <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>televisions. The students believe this initiative is beneficial as </span>it will <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>have chairs </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>provide a space for socializing </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>televisions </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>relaxation, similar to what dormitory residents enjoy. Additionally, the lounge will feature a bulletin board </span>for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>students. Students think the plan is very nice because they have realized </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>sharing information relevant to commuter students' needs. The students feel </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>many students in college spend many time watching TV </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>this lounge will foster a sense of community among commuters, offering opportunities for carpooling </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>it will be very crowded. And if the school builds a new luggage for the students to share the resources, it will maybe be more free. And also the campus needs that and the two students think it will be very helpful because the luggage can make the students travel in one car instead of going to a place that with only one people and it will save money.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>cost-saving measures.</span></p><hr><p>Victoria</p><p>The woman in the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>speaking, she is great with the pen to make the canvas. And first, some students, they like to go together and to talk </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>conversation expresses her opinion </span>about the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>studies. And at next, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>university's plan to create a lounge for commuter students. She believes that this lounge, equipped with couches, chairs, and a television, will provide a space for students to socialize and relax, similar to </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>university make </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>advantages dormitory residents have. Additionally, she mentions </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>canvas, some </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>importance of a bulletin board for sharing information relevant to commuter </span>students, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>they can share the cards and they can </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>such as organizing carpooling </span>to save <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>some </span>money <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>and they can use the save money to buy some car. And it's a good way for them.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>on transportation.</span></p><hr><p>Vicky</p><p>The university <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>wants </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>plans </span>to create <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>knowledge </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>a lounge </span>for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the </span>commuter students, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>which </span>the woman <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>agrees with that opinion. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>supports. </span>She <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>thinks </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>believes </span>it will <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>be another advantage rather than now. First, the student can </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>provide additional benefits. Firstly, students will </span>have a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>large place </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>spacious area </span>to study or <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>to learn something else, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>engage in other activities, improving their academic </span>and <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>personal lives. Secondly, she feels </span>it will <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>be better </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>offer convenience </span>for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>their life and course. Second, the woman thinks it will be convenient for the student </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>students </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>go to another place.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>access different facilities.</span></p><hr><p>Cicily</p><p>The <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>university </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>university's </span>plan <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>aims to create a lounge for commuter students, providing them with a space to relax, socialize, and share information. The woman supports this plan for three main reasons. Firstly, she believes </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>creates knowledge for community students and the women have three reasons to support. And the first reason is that it's a good place to relax for the students </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>commuter students, </span>who <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>are </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>do </span>not <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>leaving the campus or farm in town. So they should have </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>live on campus, deserve </span>a place to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>rest. And </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>rest and unwind. Secondly, she sees </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>second reason is that it has good opportunities </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lounge as a great opportunity for students </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>get together </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>collaborate on projects or study together. Lastly, she mentions the potential cost-saving benefits of carpooling </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>work or do some projects. And the last reason is that it </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>campus, which </span>can <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>help students </span>save <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the money. So they can take the cars, take the one cars, also can save the money, also waste the time to waste the car.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>money and time.</span></p><hr><p>Leon</p><p>The university's plan to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>make </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>create </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>luncheon so </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lounge for commuter students aims to provide them with similar advantages to dormitory residents. The woman agrees with this plan, citing two reasons. Firstly, she believes </span>that the <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lounge will allow </span>students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>who live in </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>to collaborate and seek help when facing academic challenges. Secondly, she points out that sharing rides to </span>campus can <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>have the same advantage as humanitarian </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>help </span>students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>have, and the woman thinks the opinion is totally right, and gave two reasons. First, he thinks that the students who use the luncheon can work together and ask each other if they have some problems they don't understand, and second, they can </span>save <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>money because they will share the chair to each other.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>money.</span></p><hr><p>Tina</p><p>The university plans to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>provide commute students with </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>create </span>special lounge <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>centres </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>areas for commuter students, equipped </span>with couches, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>chairs </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>chairs, </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>televisions, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>televisions. This initiative aims to promote socialization </span>and <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>relaxation among students, catering to their specific needs. I believe </span>this <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>decision can make the students be more socialised and relaxing and be more useful when they are cruising. And what I think </span>is a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>nice </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>positive </span>idea because <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>this school has </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>it can enhance the overall student experience and provide </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lot of people </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>space for off-campus students to unwind </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>this </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>connect with others. Additionally, the bulletin board feature </span>can <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>control students' lives and the students on campus, if they don't have anything to recreate, they will feel boring and this decision will also </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>facilitate important information sharing, such as ride-sharing opportunities, which can </span>help <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the </span>students save money and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>they can use this learning to do </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>engage in </span>more <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>valuable things, for example, like travelling or tutoring.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>meaningful activities.</span></p><hr><p>Zao</p><p>The <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>announcement says that the </span>university <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>will </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>plans to </span>create a lounge <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>for commuter students. They have two benefits. First is, it can give commuter students all social and relaxed opportunities. What's more, it can give commuter students an advantage that same with dorm students. And from the conversation of boy and girl, agree with this, they think the dorm lounge, they are only watching TV, and if open </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>specifically </span>for commuter students, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>they can study </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>offering them a space to socialize </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>work. And </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>relax, similar to what dormitory residents currently have. The woman in </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>good thing is posting stuff, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>conversation agrees with this idea, highlighting the importance of such communal spaces in fostering student connections </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>they can </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>academic support. She also appreciates the opportunity for commuter students to </span>share <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>in their car rides, so that all students can use one car, and it can </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>information, such as organizing carpooling to </span>save money and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>save </span>time <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>on commuting </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>go anywhere in the universities. Thank you.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>campus.</span></p><hr><p>Steven</p><p>The woman <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>thinks this </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>finds the university's </span>plan <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>to create a lounge for commuter students </span>very <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>nice because </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>appealing. She believes that students residing in dormitories spend an excessive amount of time in their lounges and feels that having a similar space for commuter students would be beneficial. Additionally, </span>she <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>thinks </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>appreciates </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>students have spent too much time at the dormitory lounge and plus she likes </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>idea of </span>posting <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>stuff, she thinks students can share something there and it's </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>information on a bulletin board as </span>a way <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>for students </span>to <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>share resources and potentially </span>save <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>students' money.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>money through activities like ride-sharing.</span></p><hr><p>August</p><p>The university's plan is to create a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lodge </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lounge </span>for commuter <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>students to provide them with a similar experience to dormitory residents. The lounge will offer a comfortable environment for socializing and relaxing, equipped with couches, chairs, and a television. Additionally, there will be a bulletin board for students to share useful information tailored to commuter needs. The woman supports this plan for two main reasons. Firstly, she highlights the disparity in living arrangements between dormitory and commuter </span>students, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>while they can be like </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>emphasizing </span>the <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>need for fairness. Secondly, she appreciates the opportunity for </span>students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>living in dormitories. They have a pretty good lodge, like they can play together and have a really good environment. Also the schools want </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>post stuff that students can </span>share <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>and post something. And the woman agreed with this plan, and here are two reasons she gave. The first reason is many students live in suburbs, not close </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>information, such as organizing carpooling </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>schools, can't have a great lodge like the students living in dormitories, so it is fair for the students living in the countryside or suburbs. And the second reason is the posting stuff is pretty good. The students can post and share, and it can also </span>save <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>money if the students tell them they can't travel in one car.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>on transportation costs.</span></p><hr><p>Eric</p><p>The university <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>suggested that they want </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>is planning </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>establish </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>create </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>park </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lounge for commuter students </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>let the students </span>relax and share resources. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>And </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The woman fully supports this idea because it provides a space for students who don't live in dormitories to connect and potentially share car rides. This lounge can offer a relaxing environment and facilitate </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>woman was totally agree with that because it's very nice and just like some </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>sharing of transportation, allowing </span>students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>not living in the dormitories but living in another town. It can let the students have car rides just like share with other students. And even they can have a good relaxing and they can create a public car transportation and students can pay it </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>get a transportation.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>save money on commuting.</span></p><hr><p>Joyce</p><p>The university is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>going </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>planning </span>to create a lounge for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>contemporary </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>commuter </span>students, and the woman <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>agrees, totally agrees with </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>fully supports </span>this <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>idea, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>idea. She mentions how dormitory lounges are essential for socializing </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>first </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>meeting new people, which commuter students currently lack. Additionally, </span>she <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>said that about </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>highlights </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>dorm room. Actually there's not so many students always there, and even sometimes there's some students but they just like watching </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>importance of </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>TV, and it's useless. And what's more, the woman is really like the posting stuff, that she thinks that it's a good place </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>bulletin board for sharing useful information, such as organizing carpooling </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>share information or get some other information, and also it can help students </span>save <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>their money.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>money on transportation costs.</span></p><hr><p>Michael</p><p>In the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>readings, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>reading, </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>school keeps </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>university plans to create </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>plan and provides the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>special lounge for commuter </span>students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>with special lunch </span>in the student <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>center. It can let </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>center to provide </span>them <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>take </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>with </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>relax. But </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>place to relax and socialize. The woman </span>in the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lessons, the woman </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>listening </span>agrees with <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>his opinion. And he thinks, and he has </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>this plan for </span>two <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>main </span>reasons. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>First is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Firstly, she notes </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the schools </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>commuter students </span>have never <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>been their place. And </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>had a designated space like </span>this <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>place </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>to share information and study together, similar to dormitory residents. Secondly, she mentions that commuting back and forth from home </span>can <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>let </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>be time-consuming and costly, so having a lounge on campus would allow </span>students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>share their information. And it's good for their study work. And they can watch TV and have communication there. And the second reason is that students need </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>go </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>relax without having </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>their homes and to have a relax. Or another place. It will take a long time and </span>spend <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>more money. Spend much money. And if their place has, students can stay here to have a relax. And either save the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>extra </span>money <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>to travel another place into the capital.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>on transportation.</span></p><hr><p>Alice</p><p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the policy that they will </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The university plans to </span>create a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>cart </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lounge </span>for commuter students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>because it can give commuter students large </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>to provide them with a </span>space <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>to socialize, relax, </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>some advantages and they can </span>share information <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>relevant to their needs. The woman in </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>commuter student and their particle needs and the girl in this </span>conversation <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>totally agree </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>supports </span>this idea because <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>firstly </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>she believes it will allow </span>students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>need </span>to meet <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>many people </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>new people, create study groups, </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>some people just stay </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>save money through carpooling. She highlights </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the room and watch tv or talk together and they central they miss </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>importance of such communal spaces </span>in <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>central </span>student life <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is kind of too much people </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>secondly she liked this idea because many students want </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the benefits it can bring </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>get together and share the campus they can make friends or talk something and they also can save money because they can get in one car</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>off-campus students.</span></p><hr><p>Selina</p><p>The <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>school </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>university has </span>decided to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>provide these </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>create a lounge for </span>commuter students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>with special lunch </span>in the student <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>center </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>center, equipped </span>with <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>some tours. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>couches, chairs, and a television. </span>The woman <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>agreed with that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>in the conversation supports this idea </span>because she <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>thought watch </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>believes that watching </span>TV <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is really helpful </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>there's also some </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>engaging in </span>activities <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is helpful </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>in the lounge can be beneficial </span>for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>themselves and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>students. Additionally, </span>she <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>likes </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>appreciates the opportunity </span>to post <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>their own things up </span>and share <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>information, such as organizing carpool rides, as it can help students save money and foster a sense of community. Overall, she agrees </span>with <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>each other. And she said that if they know how to get </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>rights share, they can grow up </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>plan </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>share more things and it's so helpful for themselves. So the woman agreed with that and she thinks it's </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>finds it </span>helpful.</p><hr><p>Bobby</p><p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>I find some </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Some </span>students <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>at our university </span>don't live in <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>dormitories, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>dormitories; </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>live </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>reside </span>in town <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>or the suburbs.

That </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lounge </span>is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the boy mentioned. And the second is that they are the posting staff. That means they can share cars when they go to school together. That means they will become less expensive, because few of them can travel in the same car. So all of the boys and the girls think it's </span>a good idea <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>that the school need to reduce some TV or some chairs in the demonstrate.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>for commuter students."</span></p><hr><p>Tom</p><p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>We </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>"The university has </span>decided to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>let </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>create a lounge in the student center for commuter </span>students <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>who do </span>not live in <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the dormitory, but </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>dormitories. This lounge will provide a space for socializing and relaxing, similar </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>move to the students' central. There are two reasons. Firstly, because the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>what </span>dormitory <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is too large and too many people, it was so boring. Secondly, it was boring to bond on the wall and passing to share the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>residents have. Additionally, there will be a bulletin board for sharing useful </span>information.

She believes that dormitories can be overwhelming with </span>too many <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>people. If this is moving, it </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>people and that having a separate lounge </span>can help students <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>connect better. She also mentions the benefits of sharing information, like organizing carpool rides </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>know the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>campus, which can enhance </span>students' <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>words.

Additionally, she sees the benefit of posting information, such as ride-sharing opportunities, </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>finish their homework, but there don't have any things, and the university provide these things can make them be relaxed. She thinks a good ride chairs can </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>help students </span>save money <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>to do other things like travel, and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>on transportation costs. Overall, she supports </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>televisions will make them be relaxed. She thinks </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>university's plan as a positive step in enhancing </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>universities have a good suggestion.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>student experience.</span></p><hr><p>Mike</p><p>According to the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>notice, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>announcement, </span>the university <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>has </span>decided to create a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lodge </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lounge </span>for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>computer </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>commuter </span>students for two <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>main </span>reasons.

Moreover, the students feel that the lounge </span>can <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>help with their schoolwork.

<html><body><p>Ivy</p><p>The university <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>has </span>announced <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>that they will </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>plans to </span>create a lounge <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>specifically </span>for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>commuters. So </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>commuter students. The woman in the conversation expresses her positive opinion about this plan </span>for <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>a couple of reasons. Firstly, she mentions that </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>first reason, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lounge will provide a space for socializing and relaxation. Additionally, </span>she <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>said it's </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>highlights the presence of </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>good place to socialize and relax. And second reason is there is a blinding </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>bulletin </span>board <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>and they </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>where students </span>can share <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>important information, such as organizing carpool rides to campus. Both speakers agree on </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>information. And in </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>benefits of this idea, emphasizing </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>conversation, they both agree </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>potential for students to connect </span>with <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>this idea because, firstly, there </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>others, collaborate on schoolwork, and save money through ride-sharing opportunities. Overall, the woman believes that the lounge </span>will be a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lot of people on the lounges. So the woman says that it will be a very good place to have a school work by talking with others and asking other questions. And also the woman likes the bloating boards because they can post some information like share car rides. So then </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>valuable addition </span>for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>many students who will ride the cars, they will save much more money. So the woman says this idea is very good.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>commuter students.</span></p><hr><p>Daniel</p><p>The university <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>will build </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>plans to create </span>a lounge for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the </span>commuter students who <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>do not </span>live <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>in the palm oil store area so </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>on campus but travel daily. The woman supports this idea. She believes </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>they will travel to school every day, and the woman agrees with this plan. Firstly, she thinks that if the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>having a lounge where </span>students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>are in there, they </span>can <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>relax, </span>watch TV, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>do anything they like, </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>if they know this place, maybe they </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>socialize </span>will <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>do nothing. Secondly, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>encourage them to spend more time there. Additionally, </span>she <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>thinks that it's very helpful for students to save money, so for </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>mentions the importance of saving money through activities like ride-sharing, which could benefit students. For </span>these <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>reasons </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>reasons, </span>the woman agrees with the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>plan that the university should </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>university's decision to </span>provide a lounge for commuter students.</p><hr><p>Paul</p><p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>He is going </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The university plans </span>to create a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>launch </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lounge </span>for commuter <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>students, that there are </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>students who do not live on campus. This lounge will be equipped with chairs, couches, </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lot of </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>TV, and a bulletin board for </span>students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>leaving out of the school. First, the university will provide the chairs, the couch, and TV in the student center that provide them </span>to relax and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>posting the stuff that they can write together. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>share information. </span>The woman in the conversation <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>agree </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>agrees </span>with <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>this </span>idea, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>that she thinks that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>believing </span>it will centralize the <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>off-campus </span>students' <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>social </span>life <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>as they currently lack such amenities. She also appreciates the idea </span>of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the off-campus students, that the off-campus students don't have time or things </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>sharing information, like carpooling </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>enjoy this stuff. And second, she thinks that this posting stuff is great, and they can share together, they can write together, that can </span>save <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>money, and they can write together to travel, it's a good opinion.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>money on travel expenses.</span></p><hr><p>Shelia</p><p>The university <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>will </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>plans to </span>create a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>large number of </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lounge for </span>commuter <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>students, because those </span>students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>are </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>who do </span>not <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>living </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>live on campus but travel there daily. This lounge will offer a space for socializing, relaxing, and sharing information. The woman </span>in the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>university, they live in the town, and so if they go to the campus it's a waste of time, and the students will need to have a socialized and relaxed place, and in </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>conversation finds </span>this <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>place they can share the information. The women think it's very nice, and it's a waste of time, people don't drive in the car in there, and the women think </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>idea positive as </span>it can help <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>commuter students connect with others, save time and money, and potentially improve </span>their <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>score and posting the card, and also it will sell the money.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>academic performance.</span></p><hr><p>Cameron</p><p>The university has decided to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>provide this </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>create a lounge for </span>commuter <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>student with a special lungi </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>students </span>in the student center, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>and it is used for </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>where they can </span>socialize and relax. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>In </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The students in </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>conversation, the girls and the boys think that is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>conversation believe it's </span>a good <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>idea, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>idea </span>because <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>they have experienced the benefits of having a lounge </span>in the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>first semester, he meets many </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>dorms, where they met people, watched TV, and took study breaks. They also mention the advantage of being able to post information on a bulletin board, such as ride-sharing opportunities, which can help </span>students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>in his dormitory, and most of </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>save money on daily travel expenses. Overall, they feel </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>students spend the time at lungi watching TV and talking, studying, break, studying stuff. And also, there is a benefit for students is they can post stuff on the wall. If they post some right here, they can save the money for traveling around the school every day. So that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lounge </span>will be <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>a good idea. I hope it has an accomplishment.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>beneficial for commuter students.</span></p><hr><p>Luca</p><p>The <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lecture is a minute about </span>university <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>created </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>has decided to create </span>a lounge for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the computer students, because there's </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>commuter students who do not live on campus, providing them with </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lot of students are not living </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>space to socialize and relax. The woman </span>in the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>campus. And in </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>conversation expresses her approval of this plan, highlighting </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>conversation, the girl totally liked this idea. First, she thinks </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>importance of such </span>a lounge <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is like a central school life, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>in student life. She mentions how dormitory lounges have been beneficial for meeting people </span>and <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>getting academic help, emphasizing the convenience it offers. Additionally, </span>she <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>can find a lot </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>appreciates the idea </span>of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>people who </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>sharing car rides to campus, which </span>can help <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>her in her own project, and it provides </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>students save money on transportation. Overall, she believes the lounge will be </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>huge convenience. For the second reason, the girl likes it, is they can share the car ride if they live together. In that case, it saves money </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>valuable addition </span>for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the transportation. So, like it's a really good idea for creating a lounge.

The female student agrees with this idea </span>because <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>they think </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>she believes </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>it can help </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>having a lounge will allow </span>students to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>socialize and relax, and second that students can share some useful information there, and the female students agree with this idea. This one is that because if there is no lounge, students just watch TV, and if there is lounge, they can communicate </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>interact </span>with others, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>and maybe others can </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>potentially receiving </span>help <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>their own school work. And second that, sometimes </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>with schoolwork. Additionally, she mentions the benefit of </span>students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>want </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>being able </span>to share <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>their own opinion, but they don't have the planned fare, so if there is a lounge, they can share their own opinion, and they can also </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>ride information to </span>save <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>some </span>money <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>to get one card.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>on transportation.</span></p><hr><p>Shawn</p><p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>In the proposal, the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The </span>university <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>decided </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>plans </span>to create a lounge for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the </span>commuter students for two <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>main </span>reasons. <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Firstly, it aims to provide similar advantages to those living in on-campus dormitories. Additionally, the lounge will feature a bulletin board to share essential information tailored to the needs of commuter students. </span>The <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>first point for that is, it is beneficial for them since it has the same advantages as the students who live in the dormitory on campus. And secondly, it provides a blue-toned board which shares information and it is useful to satisfy students' needs. And the </span>students in the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lecture, it is really agree with </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>discussion support </span>this proposal. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>Firstly, he suggests that it </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>One student highlights the potential for socializing and relaxation in the lounge, similar to dormitory lounges where they </span>can <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>share the times and numbers of the dormitories as it can provide the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>watch </span>TV and <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>take study breaks. The other student emphasizes </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>breaks during the leisure time. And secondly, the posting, it is very beneficial since it could be very helpful for the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>importance of posting information, such as ride-sharing opportunities, to help </span>students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>to know their rights and shares.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>save money on transportation.</span></p><hr><p>Ashlyn</p><p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>So the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The </span>university <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>wants </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>plans </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>build </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>create </span>a lounge for <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>commuter students who don't live on campus, providing a space with couches, chairs, and a television, as well as a bulletin board for sharing information. The woman believes this is a beneficial idea as it will offer commuter students a place to socialize and relax, similar to dormitory residents. She also sees </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>students that do not live </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>value </span>in the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>campus dormitory and provide a great environment </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>bulletin board </span>for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>them to sit, some poster stuff and others. And the woman thinks it's a really good idea and it will be useful for those students. So she thinks it's really useful because the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>sharing important information, like ride-sharing opportunities, which can help </span>students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>will use a lot of time for their campus and in the dormitory and it's essential for their life. And she also thinks the poster stuff is a great idea because sharing some information during their university time is really possible and it's important for students to get some information and they can also </span>save <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>their </span>money <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>because they can use one card.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>on transportation.</span></p><hr><p>Minato</p><p>The <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>girl was happy that the university noticed that point. It's 100% at what she's hoping. There were two reasons. First, there are many students spend their time and self-study </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>woman </span>in the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>dormitory. It's kind </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>conversation expressed her approval </span>of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>center </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the university's plan to create a lounge for commuter students. She believes that this initiative will be beneficial as it will provide a space for students to socialize and relax, similar to the lounges available to dormitory residents. Additionally, she mentioned the importance </span>of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>student's life. And the second point is, if many students study in this place, it also </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>having a bulletin board for sharing information that </span>could <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>help her academic performance. Also, if they go together, it also could </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>be particularly helpful for commuter students, such as organizing carpooling to campus to </span>save <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>their money because they can rotate in similar car to help their save more </span>money.</p><hr><p>Yvonne</p><p>The university <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>has </span>decided to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>provide these computer students with </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>create </span>a special lounge <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>for commuter students </span>in <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the </span>student <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>centers </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>center, equipped with couches, chairs, </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>also it is very helpful </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>a television. This initiative aims to provide a space </span>for students to socialize and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>relax. Because many students do not live in dormitories and also they live in other towns so it spend a lot of time for them </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>relax, similar </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>travel to school. And </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the advantages enjoyed by dormitory residents. The woman </span>in the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lecture </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>conversation expresses her approval of this plan, highlighting </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>girls think it is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>importance of central spaces like lounges in fostering student connections and aiding in academic endeavors. She also mentions the value of </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>nice decision because she thinks the school centrals can </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>bulletin board for posting information, such as ride shares, which could </span>help students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>to do their schoolwork and also the post team staff, they can meet a lot of other students and socialize and to make friends. And also it is, it can </span>save <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>a lot of </span>money <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>for them because they can travel to school in one cart together.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>on transportation.</span></p><hr><p>Eileen</p><p>The university <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>announces that it will </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>has decided to </span>create a special <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>dormitory </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lounge </span>for commuter students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>because it can be very useful to satisfy their special </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>in the student center, equipped with couches, chairs, </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>particular needs. And </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>a television. The woman in </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>woman totally agrees with </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>discussion supports </span>this <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>plan </span>for two <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>main </span>reasons. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>First, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Firstly, </span>she <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>thinks it </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>believes that the lounge will allow students to socialize and meet new people, similar to the experience dormitory residents have in their lounges. She mentions how she personally benefitted from meeting helpful students in the lounge during her first semester. Secondly, she appreciates the idea of a bulletin board in the lounge where students </span>can <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>really </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>share information, such as organizing carpool rides to campus. This feature could </span>help students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>to get to know many people in the lounge. And she said that she met students who really helped her with her study a lot, like they met in the lounge. And the second reason is it can really provide a place that helps students because some students want to get together and the lounge really provides a perfect place for them to gather </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>save money on transportation costs by traveling </span>together.</p><hr><p>Zoe</p><p>The <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>reading is talking about </span>university <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>plans </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>have </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>create </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>break room </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lounge </span>for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>students. They can talk </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>commuter students to socialize </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>relax </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>relax, similar to those available </span>in <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>dormitories. The woman agrees with this idea, mentioning </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>room because they think some </span>students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>live in </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>living off-campus lack such spaces for interaction and study breaks. She believes </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>town or the countryside. So they have spent many time </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lounge will facilitate connections among students and enable practical benefits like carpooling </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>get to school so the break room can help them to have time to break. And in the lesson the woman agreed with that. She is saying because people have many time and they need to talk with others so they have a place to help them. And second is they can make students get together and such as they can share their car and they can go into school in one car.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>save money on transportation.</span></p><hr><p>Jessie</p><p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>In the plan, it says that the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The </span>university <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>will </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>plans to </span>create a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lodge </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lounge </span>for <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>commuter </span>students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>to </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>who do not </span>live <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>out of the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>on </span>campus. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>And also, in the lodge, it </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>This lounge </span>will <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>provide some </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>have </span>chairs, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>some </span>televisions, and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>also some </span>couches for socializing and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>relaxing. What's more, the equipment is also the same as the equipment at the dormitory. And what's more, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>relaxing, similar to dormitory lounges. Additionally, </span>there will be <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>some volunteering </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>bulletin </span>boards <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>on the wall </span>for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>posting and </span>sharing <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>information for students. And it's a conversation we might also think </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>useful information. The woman believes this </span>is a good idea because <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>she </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>off-campus students currently lack a central place to socialize and meet others like dormitory residents do. She also </span>mentions <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>that </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>students out </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>benefits </span>of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the campus don't have the time </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>sharing ride information </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>share with students, to watch TV in the lodge. And also, the posting board can also allow students to share together with other students instead of spending time traveling </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>save money </span>on <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the car.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>transportation.</span></p><hr><p>Jay</p><p>The <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>school published </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>university has decided to create a lounge for commuter students in </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>launch </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>student center. This lounge will have couches, chairs, and a television, along with a bulletin board </span>for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>sharing important information. The woman believes that this initiative is beneficial as it will provide a place for </span>commuter <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>student and it hopes that the launch can help them </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>students </span>to socialize and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>relax. And </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>relax, similar to dormitory residents. She also mentions the importance of the lounge </span>in <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>facilitating student interactions and sharing useful information, such as organizing ride shares to campus. She feels that this lounge will enhance </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>launch they have the bulletin board on the wall to post and share information. And they think it will be useful </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>college experience </span>for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the </span>commuter <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>students to their particular needs. And the women think that it was useful to do this. And for the commuter students, it can help them how to spend time with people in the launch and help them to meet together. So it will be very special to our people, their college life. And it can be interesting to their college life and can share some information on the campus to help communicating with each other.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>students.</span></p><hr></body></html>
