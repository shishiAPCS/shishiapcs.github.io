## 外国食物

**Describe a kind of foreign food you like and you have had.** You should say:

*   What it is
*   When and where you had it
*   Why you like it
*   And explain how you feel about it.


### **Part 2: Describe a kind of foreign food you like and you have had**

The foreign food I’d like to talk about is **kefir**, which is a **fermented milk drink** originally from **Russia**. It’s quite similar to yogurt, but it has a **thinner texture** and a slightly **tangy flavour**.

I first tried it at a **friend’s party** about three years ago. He knew I loved dairy products, so he brought out this **white, creamy drink** and told me it wasn’t yogurt. At first I didn’t believe him because it looked so similar, but after one sip I could tell it was different—**lighter, more refreshing, and even a bit fizzy**. He explained that he’d got the **kefir grains** from a Russian friend. These grains are actually **living cultures** that ferment the milk and turn it into kefir.

After tasting it, I got really curious and started doing some research. I learned that kefir contains **more probiotics** than yogurt and can really **benefit the digestive system**. What also fascinated me was that you can **grow it yourself**—you just feed the grains with fresh milk every day, and they produce new kefir for you. It’s like keeping a tiny **living ecosystem** in a jar!

I love this food not only because it’s healthy but also because it gives me a sense of **connection and gratitude**. Every time I make a new batch, I’m reminded that we live in a kind of **mutual relationship** with nature—we give it something, and it gives something back. That thought always makes kefir feel extra special to me.

### **Part 3 Answers (Band 8 Target)**

**1️⃣ Do most people like to eat familiar food or try new food?**
Most people tend to stick with familiar food because it feels **safe and predictable**. Trying something completely new can be **risky**, especially when you’re not sure about the ingredients or taste. That said, when people travel or eat out with friends, they might be more **open-minded** and adventurous. So I’d say familiarity brings comfort, but curiosity sometimes wins.

**2️⃣ What kinds of foreign food are popular in your country?**
Western fast food, especially **burgers and pizzas**, are incredibly popular in China. They’re **quick to prepare**, **affordable**, and seen as a **symbol of Western lifestyle**. Besides that, **Japanese sushi** and **Korean barbecue** have become trendy, especially among young people who enjoy the **social aspect** of sharing food.

**3️⃣ Do you like to cook at home?**
I do, though not very often. Usually, my wife takes the lead in the kitchen, but I help her whenever I can—especially with **kneading dough** or **mixing ingredients**. It’s a nice way to **unwind** and spend time together. Even though I’m not a great cook, I find cooking quite **therapeutic** and rewarding.

**4️⃣ Is it expensive to eat out in your country?**
It really depends on where you go. If you eat at local diners, a meal can cost less than **10% of a person’s daily income**, which is quite affordable. But in **high-end restaurants**, the price for a single meal could **exceed a day’s salary**. So dining out can be either **cheap and cheerful** or **a real splurge**.

**5️⃣ What’s the difference between Chinese and Western food?**
The biggest difference lies in **cooking methods and ingredients**. Chinese cuisine relies heavily on **stir-frying** and **seasoning with soy sauce and spices**, while Western dishes often use **baking, grilling, or roasting**. Also, pork is a staple in Chinese food, whereas in some Western or Muslim regions, people prefer beef or lamb. The **flavour profiles** are completely different, but both are delicious in their own way.

✅ **2. Transitions:** Use soft linkers — *That said, On top of that, As a result, In everyday terms, To be honest*.
✅ **3. Ending naturally:** Wrap with reflection: *“And that’s why it’s one of my favourite foods.”*
✅ **4. Pronunciation rhythm:** Stress key nouns (*fermentation, ecosystem, gratitude*).
✅ **5. Confidence tone:** Sound curious and thoughtful—your topic (kefir) naturally suits that.
