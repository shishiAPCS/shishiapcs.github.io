## ÂèóÊ¨¢ËøéÁöÑ‰∫∫

The person I‚Äôd like to talk about is one of my students named Mason. He‚Äôs a high-school student who‚Äôs quite popular among both classmates and teachers because of his talent and friendly personality.

I see him almost every day since his classroom is next to my office, although I only teach him twice a week. What makes him stand out is his passion for music. He plays guitar, sings really well, and even manages his own channel on WeChat, where he posts cover songs and short vlogs. His videos usually get hundreds of likes and positive comments, which shows how much people enjoy his content.

One thing I admire is how he handles criticism. I once noticed a few negative comments under his post, but instead of arguing, he replied politely and even thanked people for their feedback. That level of maturity impressed me a lot. It taught me that being popular isn‚Äôt only about talent but also about attitude‚Äîhow you treat others with respect and positivity.

Even though I‚Äôm his teacher, I feel I‚Äôve learned something from him: to stay kind and confident no matter what others say. Mason‚Äôs popularity comes naturally from his authenticity, not from trying to please everyone. That‚Äôs why I think he truly deserves the attention he gets.

**Key Vocabulary:** stand out ‚Ä¢ cover songs ‚Ä¢ handle criticism ‚Ä¢ positive attitude ‚Ä¢ maturity ‚Ä¢ authenticity ‚Ä¢ deserve the attention

## üó£ Part 3 ‚Äî Popularity & Teaching (‚âà 110‚Äì130 words each, MAP structure)

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Why are some students popular at school? (MAP)

**Main:**
Students become popular mostly because of personality and talent.

**Analysis:**
Those who are friendly, humorous, or easy to talk to attract others naturally. When they add a visible skill‚Äîsuch as singing, playing sports, or leading a project‚Äîthey stand out even more. Popularity, though, can‚Äôt be forced; people sense when someone tries too hard to impress, and it often backfires. True popularity grows from authenticity and kindness rather than show-off behavior.

**Proof:**
For example, the classmate everyone greets first is usually the one who remembers birthdays or helps others revise for exams, not necessarily the loudest person in the room.

**Key Vocabulary & Collocations:** friendly vibe ‚Ä¢ stand out ‚Ä¢ show-off behavior ‚Ä¢ backfire ‚Ä¢ authenticity ‚Ä¢ naturally attract ‚Ä¢ class reputation

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Is it important for a teacher to be popular? (MAP)

**Main:**
Popularity is pleasant but not essential for teachers.

**Analysis:**
A teacher‚Äôs real duty is to educate and guide. If they chase approval, they may lower expectations or avoid strict grading just to stay ‚Äúliked.‚Äù That can harm students in the long run. Still, being approachable and fair builds respect and trust, which indirectly make a teacher well-liked without sacrificing authority.

**Proof:**
For instance, my favorite teachers were not the funniest but the ones who explained clearly, gave feedback honestly, and treated everyone equally. Their credibility made them naturally respected, which matters more than short-term popularity.

**Key Vocabulary & Collocations:** chase approval ‚Ä¢ approachable demeanor ‚Ä¢ long run impact ‚Ä¢ earn respect ‚Ä¢ build trust ‚Ä¢ maintain authority ‚Ä¢ credible teacher

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Are good teachers always popular? (MAP)

**Main:**
Not necessarily‚Äîbeing good and being popular don‚Äôt always overlap.

**Analysis:**
Excellent teachers often push students beyond comfort zones, enforce deadlines, or correct mistakes publicly. Those actions can feel harsh to teenagers, even though they promote growth. Meanwhile, lenient teachers may seem ‚Äúnice‚Äù but contribute less to progress. Popularity is emotional; quality is measurable.

**Proof:**
Many adults later admit that their strict math or English teacher‚Äîwhom they once feared‚Äîtaught them the most valuable habits of discipline and accuracy. Respect sometimes arrives years later, after results speak for themselves.

**Key Vocabulary & Collocations:** comfort zone ‚Ä¢ enforce deadlines ‚Ä¢ lenient teacher ‚Ä¢ emotional appeal ‚Ä¢ measurable results ‚Ä¢ earn respect later ‚Ä¢ discipline and accuracy

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ What qualities make a good teacher? (MAP)

**Main:**
A good teacher combines fairness, empathy, and consistency.

**Analysis:**
Rules keep the classroom safe, but empathy keeps it human. Great teachers set boundaries yet listen to students‚Äô concerns. They explain why rules exist instead of just quoting them, which builds mutual respect. They also adapt methods to different learners while staying firm on standards.

**Proof:**
For example, when a student breaks a rule, a fair teacher might assign detention but still check if the behavior stems from stress or misunderstanding. That balance between discipline and compassion earns lasting trust.

**Key Vocabulary & Collocations:** set boundaries ‚Ä¢ mutual respect ‚Ä¢ adapt methods ‚Ä¢ firm on standards ‚Ä¢ discipline and compassion ‚Ä¢ lasting trust

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Is it easier to become popular nowadays? (MAP)

**Main:**
Getting attention is easier now, but keeping popularity is harder.

**Analysis:**
Social media gives everyone a platform, so visibility costs nothing. However, because millions post daily, standing out demands creativity and authenticity. Online fame can also vanish overnight‚Äîfollowers scroll away the moment something new appears. Sustainable popularity requires consistent quality and genuine connection.

**Proof:**
Many short-video creators go viral once but fade within weeks, while steady educators or entertainers build loyal audiences over years. So exposure is cheap; influence is earned.

**Key Vocabulary & Collocations:** go viral ‚Ä¢ stand out in a crowded space ‚Ä¢ authentic content ‚Ä¢ consistent quality ‚Ä¢ genuine connection ‚Ä¢ earned influence

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Why do people want to be popular? (MAP)

**Main:**
People seek popularity because it signals acceptance and belonging.

**Analysis:**
Humans are social animals; throughout history, being part of a group increased safety and survival. Today, that instinct translates into the desire for recognition and approval. Popularity boosts self-esteem and creates a sense of importance. However, the pursuit can become unhealthy when people measure self-worth only by external validation.

**Proof:**
For example, some teenagers check ‚Äúlikes‚Äù every few minutes and feel anxious when numbers drop, showing how deeply approval ties to identity. Healthy confidence should come from achievement, not just applause.

**Key Vocabulary & Collocations:** social instinct ‚Ä¢ seek recognition ‚Ä¢ external validation ‚Ä¢ self-esteem boost ‚Ä¢ measure self-worth ‚Ä¢ crave approval

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Is popularity always a good thing? (MAP)

**Main:**
Popularity has benefits but also hidden costs.

**Analysis:**
Being well-known brings influence and opportunity, yet it reduces privacy and amplifies criticism. Celebrities often live under constant scrutiny, and public figures must maintain spotless reputations. Fame magnifies both praise and mistakes. At extremes, it can threaten safety or mental health.

**Proof:**
For instance, stars disguise themselves in public to avoid crowds, and history remembers leaders like JFK whose visibility made them targets. So while recognition feels rewarding, it carries pressure that few people can handle gracefully.

**Key Vocabulary & Collocations:** constant scrutiny ‚Ä¢ loss of privacy ‚Ä¢ magnify mistakes ‚Ä¢ handle pressure ‚Ä¢ public figure ‚Ä¢ hidden cost of fame ‚Ä¢ gracefully manage attention

## Èí¶‰Ω©ÁöÑËøêÂä®Âëò

## ü•á Part 2 ‚Äî Describe a successful sportsperson you admire (‚âà 285 words)

The sportsperson I‚Äôd like to talk about is a swimmer who broke several world records, though I have to admit I don‚Äôt actually remember his name. I first learned about him back in high school, when our Chinese teacher used his story in writing class to show what real perseverance looks like.

According to what we read, he wasn‚Äôt born a champion. Early in his career he lost many races and almost gave up, but he kept training every single morning before sunrise, even in freezing weather. I remember our teacher showing us a short documentary of him swimming in an outdoor pool covered with mist‚Äîit really stuck with me. Over the years, that dedication paid off, and he eventually set new world records and became a national hero.

Another thing that fascinated me was how his body shape gave him a slight advantage‚Äîhe had a longer torso and shorter legs, which made him more streamlined in the water. But even with that, success didn‚Äôt come easily. What truly made the difference was his mindset‚Äîhis patience, focus, and refusal to give up when progress felt slow.

I admire him because his story changed how I think about learning. Whenever I struggle with English or feel tired of working toward a goal, I picture him swimming lap after lap, never stopping. It reminds me that consistency beats talent in the long run, and that steady effort‚Äîno matter how small‚Äîcan lead to something remarkable.

**Key Vocabulary & Collocations:** broke world records ‚Ä¢ born a champion ‚Ä¢ every single morning ‚Ä¢ stuck with me ‚Ä¢ paid off ‚Ä¢ streamlined in the water ‚Ä¢ refusal to give up ‚Ä¢ consistency beats talent ‚Ä¢ steady effort ‚Ä¢ something remarkable

## üèÖ Part 3 ‚Äî Sports Discussion (‚âà 110‚Äì130 words each, MAP structure)

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Should students have physical education at school? (MAP)

**Main:**
Yes, PE is essential because it shapes both physical and mental health.

**Analysis:**
Regular exercise builds habits of discipline, teamwork, and time management. It also releases stress and helps students concentrate better in academic subjects. Beyond fitness, sports teach life lessons‚Äîhandling defeat, cooperating with others, and respecting rules‚Äîall of which prepare young people for real-world challenges.

**Proof:**
For example, team competitions help shy students develop confidence, while daily warm-ups keep energy levels steady through long school days. Without PE, children may drift toward screen time and lose balance between body and mind.

**Key Vocabulary & Collocations:** build healthy habits ‚Ä¢ release stress ‚Ä¢ handle defeat ‚Ä¢ real-world challenges ‚Ä¢ team spirit ‚Ä¢ screen time ‚Ä¢ balance between body and mind

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ What qualities should an athlete have? (MAP)

**Main:**
Resilience is the cornerstone quality every athlete needs.

**Analysis:**
Sport is full of ups and downs‚Äîinjuries, losses, and public pressure‚Äîso mental toughness matters as much as physical skill. Discipline keeps athletes training even when motivation dips, while patience allows long-term progress. Finally, humility prevents success from turning into arrogance and keeps focus on growth rather than fame.

**Proof:**
Take Olympic athletes: they repeat the same motion thousands of times before perfecting it, yet still thank their coaches after winning. That mix of grit, routine, and modesty separates champions from ordinary players.

**Key Vocabulary & Collocations:** mental toughness ‚Ä¢ bounce back ‚Ä¢ stay disciplined ‚Ä¢ long-term progress ‚Ä¢ grit and routine ‚Ä¢ keep a humble mindset ‚Ä¢ separate champions from ordinary players

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Is talent or hard work more important in sports? (MAP)

**Main:**
Hard work outweighs talent over time.

**Analysis:**
Natural ability gives a head start, but only consistent effort transforms potential into performance. Hard work builds endurance, strategy, and resilience‚Äîthe invisible factors that win championships. Talent sets the ceiling; effort decides how close you get to it.

**Proof:**
Take Michael Phelps: his physique helped, but his relentless training‚Äîsix hours a day, six days a week‚Äîmade him legendary. Countless gifted athletes faded because they lacked that persistence. So while talent opens doors, discipline keeps them open.

**Key Vocabulary & Collocations:** head start ‚Ä¢ transform potential into performance ‚Ä¢ consistent effort ‚Ä¢ relentless training ‚Ä¢ stay disciplined ‚Ä¢ open doors vs. keep them open ‚Ä¢ outwork talent

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Is it easy to identify children‚Äôs talents in sports? (MAP)

**Main:**
Not really‚Äîreal talent takes time to surface.

**Analysis:**
Early ability can be misleading; coordination and motivation develop at different ages. Parents and coaches should observe patterns of enthusiasm, persistence, and adaptability rather than rely on quick tests. Technology like motion-tracking offers clues, but raw data can‚Äôt measure passion.

**Proof:**
A child who practices badminton daily out of sheer enjoyment may surpass a ‚Äúnaturally gifted‚Äù peer who trains half-heartedly. Talent, in the end, is curiosity that survives repetition.

**Key Vocabulary & Collocations:** surface over time ‚Ä¢ observe patterns ‚Ä¢ natural coordination ‚Ä¢ raw data vs. passion ‚Ä¢ half-hearted training ‚Ä¢ curiosity that survives repetition ‚Ä¢ early ability can mislead

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ What‚Äôs the most popular sport in your country? (MAP)

**Main:**
Table tennis clearly tops the list in China.

**Analysis:**
It‚Äôs inexpensive, space-saving, and suits the average body build of many players, which makes it widely accessible. National success also fuels enthusiasm‚Äîeach gold medal reinforces collective pride and inspires the next generation. Moreover, the sport values precision and focus, qualities admired in Chinese culture.

**Proof:**
Most schools have tables, and families often play together after dinner while televised matches draw nationwide audiences. So table tennis isn‚Äôt just recreation‚Äîit‚Äôs part of national identity.

**Key Vocabulary & Collocations:** national pride ‚Ä¢ accessible sport ‚Ä¢ precision and focus ‚Ä¢ collective spirit ‚Ä¢ next generation ‚Ä¢ part of national identity ‚Ä¢ space-saving game

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Why are there so few top athletes in the world? (MAP)

**Main:**
Because excellence demands a rare mix of talent, opportunity, and endurance.

**Analysis:**
Only a handful of people possess the physical gifts, financial support, and psychological stamina needed for world-class performance. Training at that level means sacrificing comfort, social life, and even long-term health. Timing also matters‚Äîinjury or one missed season can end a career.

**Proof:**
Many athletes with Olympic potential never reach finals because they lack access to elite coaching or must quit for financial reasons. At the top, the margin between first and fifth is milliseconds‚Äîproof of how narrow the path truly is.

**Key Vocabulary & Collocations:** world-class performance ‚Ä¢ psychological stamina ‚Ä¢ sacrifice comfort ‚Ä¢ elite coaching ‚Ä¢ margin of seconds ‚Ä¢ narrow path to excellence ‚Ä¢ rare combination of factors

## Á•ñËæàÁöÑÂ∑•‰Ωú

**Describe one of your grandparent‚Äôs jobs.** You should say:

*   What it was
*   How long he or she had this job
*   How he or she got the job
*   What skills this job needed
*   And whether you would like to have this job in the future

### Part 2: Describe one of your grandparent‚Äôs jobs

I‚Äôll talk about my **grandfather on my dad‚Äôs side**, who spent his whole life as a **rice farmer**. He didn‚Äôt ‚Äúget‚Äù the job in the modern sense‚Äîit was **passed down with the land**. He started young, learned from his parents, and then kept going, season after season, until the rhythm of the fields felt like a clock in his body.

What struck me was the **discipline** it took. In **early spring**, he‚Äôd **wake before dawn**, eat quickly, and step into the paddies **ankle-deep in cold water**. Transplanting seedlings looks simple until you try it for hours: your back aches, your hands wrinkle, and you still have **rows to finish**. During **harvest**, the days were heavier, not shorter‚Äîcutting, bundling, drying, and praying the weather wouldn‚Äôt turn.

On paper, the job is a checklist‚Äî**timing, irrigation, pest control, storage**. In real life, it‚Äôs **judgment and patience**. He‚Äôd glance at the sky and somehow know if the rain would hold. He **fixed tools instead of replacing them**, and he **tracked rainfall in a notebook** like it was money in a ledger. When I visited, he didn‚Äôt give speeches. He just **kept moving**, and I learned by trying to keep up.

Would I do that job? **Honestly, no.** I admire it, but I‚Äôm used to work where **feedback is quick** and results are **visible**. Farming asks you to **trust the process** for months, even when the market is uncertain and the sky is stubbornly grey. Still, his habits live in me: **show up early**, **do the boring bits well**, and **let the harvest come when it‚Äôs ready**. I may not farm, but that mindset feeds my life.

**Key Vocabulary & Collocations:** passed down with the land ‚Ä¢ wake before dawn ‚Ä¢ ankle-deep in cold water ‚Ä¢ rows to finish ‚Ä¢ judgment and patience ‚Ä¢ track rainfall ‚Ä¢ fix tools instead of replacing ‚Ä¢ trust the process ‚Ä¢ stubbornly grey ‚Ä¢ do the boring bits well ‚Ä¢ let the harvest come

Each ‚âà 110‚Äì130 words.

### 1\. What jobs are rather difficult? (MAP)

**Main:** Creative work is genuinely hard.  
**Analysis:** Unlike checklist jobs, creativity moves on messy timelines‚Äîyou can grind for days and then get one idea in the shower. You also live with drafts that aren‚Äôt good yet, manage self-doubt, and still meet a deadline. Briefs are often vague, so you‚Äôre expected to invent the target and then hit it.  
**Proof:** When I write or design, I can prepare and show up, but the ‚Äúaha‚Äù moment never follows a schedule. Musicians sketch ten melodies to keep one; painters fill a notebook to save a single frame. That mix of **uncertainty**, **pressure**, and **judgment** makes creative roles tough.

**Key Vocabulary & Collocations:** non-linear progress ‚Ä¢ vague brief ‚Ä¢ ‚Äúaha‚Äù moment ‚Ä¢ live with drafts ‚Ä¢ meet a deadline ‚Ä¢ uncertainty and pressure ‚Ä¢ invent the target

* * *

### 2\. What qualities help people do difficult jobs well? (MAP)

**Main:** **Resilience** and **calm decision-making** make the difference.  
**Analysis:** Tough roles bring late results and moving targets. Resilience keeps you engaged; calm thinking prevents panic choices. After that, systems help‚Äîchecklists, short reflections, and tiny daily wins‚Äîso pressure becomes routine. Humility also speeds learning because you take feedback without getting defensive.  
**Proof:** Think of a ship‚Äôs captain. They drill in fair weather so that, in a storm‚Äîor even a piracy alert‚Äîthe crew follows steps almost automatically. In my work, a quick post-mortem after a rough day stops the same mistake repeating.

**Key Vocabulary & Collocations:** resilience under pressure ‚Ä¢ calm decision-making ‚Ä¢ moving targets ‚Ä¢ tiny daily wins ‚Ä¢ take feedback ‚Ä¢ post-mortem ‚Ä¢ becomes routine

* * *

### 3\. Do difficult jobs deserve higher salaries? (MAP)

**Main:** Not automatically‚Äî**pay follows value and scarcity**, not just effort.  
**Analysis:** Some roles are grueling but easy to replace; others look effortless but scale impact across thousands of users. Markets reward rare skills, measurable outcomes, and the ability to **move the needle**. Effort matters, but if output is limited or demand is small, salaries stay modest.  
**Proof:** One artisan could spend a thousand hours on a needle; a factory makes millions. The factory wins on price. Meanwhile, a strong product tweak may look small but lift revenue for years‚Äîthat‚Äôs leverage.

**Key Vocabulary & Collocations:** value and scarcity ‚Ä¢ grueling vs replaceable ‚Ä¢ measurable outcomes ‚Ä¢ move the needle ‚Ä¢ limited output ‚Ä¢ leverage

* * *

### 4\. What are the differences between difficult and easy jobs? (MAP)

**Main:** **Complexity** and **coordination** separate them.  
**Analysis:** Hard jobs involve interdependent tasks, specialised knowledge, and team timing. You balance trade-offs: speed vs quality, cost vs safety. Easier jobs are more routine, solo, and predictable, with fewer variables. **Consequence** also matters: the higher the stakes, the tougher the role feels.  
**Proof:** Running a hospital shift isn‚Äôt just ‚Äúbe efficient.‚Äù It‚Äôs triage, protocols, scarce resources, and cross-department communication. One delay ripples through the system.

**Key Vocabulary & Collocations:** interdependent tasks ‚Ä¢ team timing ‚Ä¢ trade-offs ‚Ä¢ routine and predictable ‚Ä¢ higher stakes ‚Ä¢ ripple effects

* * *

### 5\. Can robots replace humans in every industry? (MAP)

**Main:** No‚Äî**human-centred** work resists full automation.  
**Analysis:** Robots excel at precision, repetition, and data-heavy tasks, but they don‚Äôt do **empathy**, **moral judgment**, or **trust-building**. Many services are relationships, not just transactions. Even with AI support, someone must set goals, take responsibility, and explain decisions in human terms.  
**Proof:** In education, a good teacher doesn‚Äôt only deliver content. They notice who‚Äôs anxious, who‚Äôs pretending, and who needs encouragement. That emotional calibration changes outcomes.

**Key Vocabulary & Collocations:** human-centred work ‚Ä¢ empathy ‚Ä¢ moral judgment ‚Ä¢ trust-building ‚Ä¢ take responsibility ‚Ä¢ emotional calibration

* * *

### 6\. What role can robots play in car manufacturing? (MAP)

**Main:** Robots should **dominate precision stages**; humans **own oversight and change**.  
**Analysis:** Welding, painting, sealing, and inspection benefit from consistency and 24/7 stamina. Sensors catch micro-defects the eye misses. But when parts change, supply hiccups happen, or a safety call is needed, humans decide, redesign, and restart the line.  
**Proof:** Modern plants run robotic cells for **body-in-white** welding and paint shops, while engineers monitor dashboards and tweak parameters. When a new model launches, people adapt fixtures, update software, and retrain processes.

**Key Vocabulary & Collocations:** dominate precision stages ‚Ä¢ body-in-white ‚Ä¢ micro-defects ‚Ä¢ monitor dashboards ‚Ä¢ tweak parameters ‚Ä¢ adapt fixtures ‚Ä¢ restart the line

## Â§ñÂõΩÈ£üÁâ©

**Describe a kind of foreign food you like and you have had.** You should say:

*   What it is
*   When and where you had it
*   Why you like it
*   And explain how you feel about it.


### **Part 2: Describe a kind of foreign food you like and you have had**

The foreign food I‚Äôd like to talk about is **kefir**, which is a **fermented milk drink** originally from **Russia**. It‚Äôs quite similar to yogurt, but it has a **thinner texture** and a slightly **tangy flavour**.

I first tried it at a **friend‚Äôs party** about three years ago. He knew I loved dairy products, so he brought out this **white, creamy drink** and told me it wasn‚Äôt yogurt. At first I didn‚Äôt believe him because it looked so similar, but after one sip I could tell it was different‚Äî**lighter, more refreshing, and even a bit fizzy**. He explained that he‚Äôd got the **kefir grains** from a Russian friend. These grains are actually **living cultures** that ferment the milk and turn it into kefir.

After tasting it, I got really curious and started doing some research. I learned that kefir contains **more probiotics** than yogurt and can really **benefit the digestive system**. What also fascinated me was that you can **grow it yourself**‚Äîyou just feed the grains with fresh milk every day, and they produce new kefir for you. It‚Äôs like keeping a tiny **living ecosystem** in a jar!

I love this food not only because it‚Äôs healthy but also because it gives me a sense of **connection and gratitude**. Every time I make a new batch, I‚Äôm reminded that we live in a kind of **mutual relationship** with nature‚Äîwe give it something, and it gives something back. That thought always makes kefir feel extra special to me.

---

**Key Vocabulary & Collocations:**
fermented milk drink ‚Ä¢ tangy flavour ‚Ä¢ creamy texture ‚Ä¢ living cultures ‚Ä¢ digestive system ‚Ä¢ grow it yourself ‚Ä¢ living ecosystem ‚Ä¢ mutual relationship ‚Ä¢ give-and-take ‚Ä¢ feel extra special

---

### **Part 3 Answers (Band 8 Target)**

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Do most people like to eat familiar food or try new food?**
Most people tend to stick with familiar food because it feels **safe and predictable**. Trying something completely new can be **risky**, especially when you‚Äôre not sure about the ingredients or taste. That said, when people travel or eat out with friends, they might be more **open-minded** and adventurous. So I‚Äôd say familiarity brings comfort, but curiosity sometimes wins.

**2Ô∏è‚É£ What kinds of foreign food are popular in your country?**
Western fast food, especially **burgers and pizzas**, are incredibly popular in China. They‚Äôre **quick to prepare**, **affordable**, and seen as a **symbol of Western lifestyle**. Besides that, **Japanese sushi** and **Korean barbecue** have become trendy, especially among young people who enjoy the **social aspect** of sharing food.

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Do you like to cook at home?**
I do, though not very often. Usually, my wife takes the lead in the kitchen, but I help her whenever I can‚Äîespecially with **kneading dough** or **mixing ingredients**. It‚Äôs a nice way to **unwind** and spend time together. Even though I‚Äôm not a great cook, I find cooking quite **therapeutic** and rewarding.

**4Ô∏è‚É£ Is it expensive to eat out in your country?**
It really depends on where you go. If you eat at local diners, a meal can cost less than **10% of a person‚Äôs daily income**, which is quite affordable. But in **high-end restaurants**, the price for a single meal could **exceed a day‚Äôs salary**. So dining out can be either **cheap and cheerful** or **a real splurge**.

**5Ô∏è‚É£ What‚Äôs the difference between Chinese and Western food?**
The biggest difference lies in **cooking methods and ingredients**. Chinese cuisine relies heavily on **stir-frying** and **seasoning with soy sauce and spices**, while Western dishes often use **baking, grilling, or roasting**. Also, pork is a staple in Chinese food, whereas in some Western or Muslim regions, people prefer beef or lamb. The **flavour profiles** are completely different, but both are delicious in their own way.

---

**Key Vocabulary & Collocations:**
safe and predictable ‚Ä¢ open-minded and adventurous ‚Ä¢ symbol of Western lifestyle ‚Ä¢ social aspect ‚Ä¢ unwind ‚Ä¢ cheap and cheerful ‚Ä¢ real splurge ‚Ä¢ stir-frying ‚Ä¢ flavour profile ‚Ä¢ take the lead in the kitchen
