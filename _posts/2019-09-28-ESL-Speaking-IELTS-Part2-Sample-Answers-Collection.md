## 钦佩的运动员

## 🥇 Part 2 — Describe a successful sportsperson you admire (≈ 285 words)

The sportsperson I’d like to talk about is a swimmer who broke several world records, though I have to admit I don’t actually remember his name. I first learned about him back in high school, when our Chinese teacher used his story in writing class to show what real perseverance looks like.

According to what we read, he wasn’t born a champion. Early in his career he lost many races and almost gave up, but he kept training every single morning before sunrise, even in freezing weather. I remember our teacher showing us a short documentary of him swimming in an outdoor pool covered with mist—it really stuck with me. Over the years, that dedication paid off, and he eventually set new world records and became a national hero.

Another thing that fascinated me was how his body shape gave him a slight advantage—he had a longer torso and shorter legs, which made him more streamlined in the water. But even with that, success didn’t come easily. What truly made the difference was his mindset—his patience, focus, and refusal to give up when progress felt slow.

I admire him because his story changed how I think about learning. Whenever I struggle with English or feel tired of working toward a goal, I picture him swimming lap after lap, never stopping. It reminds me that consistency beats talent in the long run, and that steady effort—no matter how small—can lead to something remarkable.

**Key Vocabulary & Collocations:** broke world records • born a champion • every single morning • stuck with me • paid off • streamlined in the water • refusal to give up • consistency beats talent • steady effort • something remarkable

## 💬 Part 3 — Discussion

### 1️⃣ Should students have physical education at school? (≈ 120 words)

Absolutely. Physical education isn’t just about playing games—it builds healthy habits, discipline, and teamwork. When students exercise regularly, their concentration in class improves and they release stress more easily. Moreover, PE teaches students how to face challenges and accept both winning and losing, which mirrors real life. From a schoolwide perspective, sports also create community spirit; school competitions and team practices help students bond across grades. Without PE, children might spend too much time glued to screens and lose that balance between body and mind. In short, physical education strengthens not only muscles but also character, which is equally valuable for lifelong learning.

### 2️⃣ What qualities should an athlete have? (≈ 115 words)

I believe the most important quality is resilience—the ability to bounce back after failure. Athletes face constant pressure, injuries, and competition, so a strong mindset is essential. Beyond that, self-discipline matters a lot because talent alone fades without structure. They also need patience, since real progress often takes years of repetitive training. For example, Olympic champions usually practice the same move thousands of times before perfecting it. On top of that, humility is key; once an athlete becomes successful, staying grounded helps them focus on long-term goals instead of fame. Altogether, these traits—resilience, discipline, patience, and humility—are what separate great athletes from ordinary ones.

---

### 3️⃣ Is talent or hard work more important in sports? (≈ 125 words)

Both play a role, but in my opinion, hard work carries more weight. Talent gives someone a head start, yet without persistence it quickly fades. Hard work builds habits, endurance, and confidence through repetition. Think about athletes like Michael Phelps—his physical advantages mattered, but what truly set him apart was his relentless training schedule. Moreover, hard work levels the playing field; even someone with average talent can outperform a naturally gifted rival if they train consistently. In the long run, effort compounds like interest—the more you invest, the greater the return. So while talent might open the door, it’s dedication and practice that keep it open.

---

### 4️⃣ Is it easy to identify children’s talents in sports? (≈ 115 words)

Not really—it usually takes time and exposure to different activities. Some kids show obvious talent early on, like natural balance or fast reflexes, but others develop later once they find something they truly enjoy. From a parent’s perspective, it’s more about observation and patience than quick judgment. Schools can also help by providing a variety of sports so children can experiment. Nowadays, technology such as motion-tracking or fitness testing can offer clues, but numbers don’t tell the full story. Motivation and interest matter just as much. So identifying a child’s talent isn’t a one-time test—it’s a gradual process of watching how they respond to challenges and improvement.

---

### 5️⃣ What’s the most popular sport in your country? (≈ 110 words)

Without question, table tennis is the most popular sport in China. Nearly every school has tables, and kids start playing at a very young age. It’s affordable, doesn’t need a large space, and suits the average body type of many Chinese people, which makes it accessible to almost everyone. On top of that, China has produced many world champions, so there’s a strong sense of national pride attached to it. We often see televised tournaments where families watch together, cheering for their favorite players. It’s more than just a pastime—it’s a cultural symbol that represents discipline, precision, and the collective spirit of teamwork.

---

### 6️⃣ Why are there so few top athletes in the world? (≈ 125 words)

Because reaching the top requires a rare combination of factors—talent, opportunity, resources, and an extraordinary work ethic. There are only a few spots for world-class athletes, and competition is fierce. Many people have potential but can’t access professional coaching or financial support. Others simply don’t have the mental toughness to endure the long, repetitive training and the pressure of performance. Moreover, success in sports often depends on timing—being in the right environment at the right moment. For example, some athletes peak too early or get injured before major events. So it’s not that others aren’t capable; it’s just that the stars have to align for someone to truly reach the world stage.

## 祖辈的工作

**Describe one of your grandparent’s jobs.** You should say:

*   What it was
*   How long he or she had this job
*   How he or she got the job
*   What skills this job needed
*   And whether you would like to have this job in the future

### Part 2: Describe one of your grandparent’s jobs

I’ll talk about my **grandfather on my dad’s side**, who spent his whole life as a **rice farmer**. He didn’t “get” the job in the modern sense—it was **passed down with the land**. He started young, learned from his parents, and then kept going, season after season, until the rhythm of the fields felt like a clock in his body.

What struck me was the **discipline** it took. In **early spring**, he’d **wake before dawn**, eat quickly, and step into the paddies **ankle-deep in cold water**. Transplanting seedlings looks simple until you try it for hours: your back aches, your hands wrinkle, and you still have **rows to finish**. During **harvest**, the days were heavier, not shorter—cutting, bundling, drying, and praying the weather wouldn’t turn.

On paper, the job is a checklist—**timing, irrigation, pest control, storage**. In real life, it’s **judgment and patience**. He’d glance at the sky and somehow know if the rain would hold. He **fixed tools instead of replacing them**, and he **tracked rainfall in a notebook** like it was money in a ledger. When I visited, he didn’t give speeches. He just **kept moving**, and I learned by trying to keep up.

Would I do that job? **Honestly, no.** I admire it, but I’m used to work where **feedback is quick** and results are **visible**. Farming asks you to **trust the process** for months, even when the market is uncertain and the sky is stubbornly grey. Still, his habits live in me: **show up early**, **do the boring bits well**, and **let the harvest come when it’s ready**. I may not farm, but that mindset feeds my life.

**Key Vocabulary & Collocations:** passed down with the land • wake before dawn • ankle-deep in cold water • rows to finish • judgment and patience • track rainfall • fix tools instead of replacing • trust the process • stubbornly grey • do the boring bits well • let the harvest come

困难工作与自动化
--------

Each ≈ 110–130 words.

### 1\. What jobs are rather difficult? (MAP)

**Main:** Creative work is genuinely hard.  
**Analysis:** Unlike checklist jobs, creativity moves on messy timelines—you can grind for days and then get one idea in the shower. You also live with drafts that aren’t good yet, manage self-doubt, and still meet a deadline. Briefs are often vague, so you’re expected to invent the target and then hit it.  
**Proof:** When I write or design, I can prepare and show up, but the “aha” moment never follows a schedule. Musicians sketch ten melodies to keep one; painters fill a notebook to save a single frame. That mix of **uncertainty**, **pressure**, and **judgment** makes creative roles tough.

**Key Vocabulary & Collocations:** non-linear progress • vague brief • “aha” moment • live with drafts • meet a deadline • uncertainty and pressure • invent the target

* * *

### 2\. What qualities help people do difficult jobs well? (MAP)

**Main:** **Resilience** and **calm decision-making** make the difference.  
**Analysis:** Tough roles bring late results and moving targets. Resilience keeps you engaged; calm thinking prevents panic choices. After that, systems help—checklists, short reflections, and tiny daily wins—so pressure becomes routine. Humility also speeds learning because you take feedback without getting defensive.  
**Proof:** Think of a ship’s captain. They drill in fair weather so that, in a storm—or even a piracy alert—the crew follows steps almost automatically. In my work, a quick post-mortem after a rough day stops the same mistake repeating.

**Key Vocabulary & Collocations:** resilience under pressure • calm decision-making • moving targets • tiny daily wins • take feedback • post-mortem • becomes routine

* * *

### 3\. Do difficult jobs deserve higher salaries? (MAP)

**Main:** Not automatically—**pay follows value and scarcity**, not just effort.  
**Analysis:** Some roles are grueling but easy to replace; others look effortless but scale impact across thousands of users. Markets reward rare skills, measurable outcomes, and the ability to **move the needle**. Effort matters, but if output is limited or demand is small, salaries stay modest.  
**Proof:** One artisan could spend a thousand hours on a needle; a factory makes millions. The factory wins on price. Meanwhile, a strong product tweak may look small but lift revenue for years—that’s leverage.

**Key Vocabulary & Collocations:** value and scarcity • grueling vs replaceable • measurable outcomes • move the needle • limited output • leverage

* * *

### 4\. What are the differences between difficult and easy jobs? (MAP)

**Main:** **Complexity** and **coordination** separate them.  
**Analysis:** Hard jobs involve interdependent tasks, specialised knowledge, and team timing. You balance trade-offs: speed vs quality, cost vs safety. Easier jobs are more routine, solo, and predictable, with fewer variables. **Consequence** also matters: the higher the stakes, the tougher the role feels.  
**Proof:** Running a hospital shift isn’t just “be efficient.” It’s triage, protocols, scarce resources, and cross-department communication. One delay ripples through the system.

**Key Vocabulary & Collocations:** interdependent tasks • team timing • trade-offs • routine and predictable • higher stakes • ripple effects

* * *

### 5\. Can robots replace humans in every industry? (MAP)

**Main:** No—**human-centred** work resists full automation.  
**Analysis:** Robots excel at precision, repetition, and data-heavy tasks, but they don’t do **empathy**, **moral judgment**, or **trust-building**. Many services are relationships, not just transactions. Even with AI support, someone must set goals, take responsibility, and explain decisions in human terms.  
**Proof:** In education, a good teacher doesn’t only deliver content. They notice who’s anxious, who’s pretending, and who needs encouragement. That emotional calibration changes outcomes.

**Key Vocabulary & Collocations:** human-centred work • empathy • moral judgment • trust-building • take responsibility • emotional calibration

* * *

### 6\. What role can robots play in car manufacturing? (MAP)

**Main:** Robots should **dominate precision stages**; humans **own oversight and change**.  
**Analysis:** Welding, painting, sealing, and inspection benefit from consistency and 24/7 stamina. Sensors catch micro-defects the eye misses. But when parts change, supply hiccups happen, or a safety call is needed, humans decide, redesign, and restart the line.  
**Proof:** Modern plants run robotic cells for **body-in-white** welding and paint shops, while engineers monitor dashboards and tweak parameters. When a new model launches, people adapt fixtures, update software, and retrain processes.

**Key Vocabulary & Collocations:** dominate precision stages • body-in-white • micro-defects • monitor dashboards • tweak parameters • adapt fixtures • restart the line

## 外国食物

**Describe a kind of foreign food you like and you have had.** You should say:

*   What it is
*   When and where you had it
*   Why you like it
*   And explain how you feel about it.


### **Part 2: Describe a kind of foreign food you like and you have had**

The foreign food I’d like to talk about is **kefir**, which is a **fermented milk drink** originally from **Russia**. It’s quite similar to yogurt, but it has a **thinner texture** and a slightly **tangy flavour**.

I first tried it at a **friend’s party** about three years ago. He knew I loved dairy products, so he brought out this **white, creamy drink** and told me it wasn’t yogurt. At first I didn’t believe him because it looked so similar, but after one sip I could tell it was different—**lighter, more refreshing, and even a bit fizzy**. He explained that he’d got the **kefir grains** from a Russian friend. These grains are actually **living cultures** that ferment the milk and turn it into kefir.

After tasting it, I got really curious and started doing some research. I learned that kefir contains **more probiotics** than yogurt and can really **benefit the digestive system**. What also fascinated me was that you can **grow it yourself**—you just feed the grains with fresh milk every day, and they produce new kefir for you. It’s like keeping a tiny **living ecosystem** in a jar!

I love this food not only because it’s healthy but also because it gives me a sense of **connection and gratitude**. Every time I make a new batch, I’m reminded that we live in a kind of **mutual relationship** with nature—we give it something, and it gives something back. That thought always makes kefir feel extra special to me.

**Key Vocabulary & Collocations:**
fermented milk drink • tangy flavour • creamy texture • living cultures • digestive system • grow it yourself • living ecosystem • mutual relationship • give-and-take • feel extra special

### **Part 3 Answers (Band 8 Target)**

**1️⃣ Do most people like to eat familiar food or try new food?**
Most people tend to stick with familiar food because it feels **safe and predictable**. Trying something completely new can be **risky**, especially when you’re not sure about the ingredients or taste. That said, when people travel or eat out with friends, they might be more **open-minded** and adventurous. So I’d say familiarity brings comfort, but curiosity sometimes wins.

**2️⃣ What kinds of foreign food are popular in your country?**
Western fast food, especially **burgers and pizzas**, are incredibly popular in China. They’re **quick to prepare**, **affordable**, and seen as a **symbol of Western lifestyle**. Besides that, **Japanese sushi** and **Korean barbecue** have become trendy, especially among young people who enjoy the **social aspect** of sharing food.

**3️⃣ Do you like to cook at home?**
I do, though not very often. Usually, my wife takes the lead in the kitchen, but I help her whenever I can—especially with **kneading dough** or **mixing ingredients**. It’s a nice way to **unwind** and spend time together. Even though I’m not a great cook, I find cooking quite **therapeutic** and rewarding.

**4️⃣ Is it expensive to eat out in your country?**
It really depends on where you go. If you eat at local diners, a meal can cost less than **10% of a person’s daily income**, which is quite affordable. But in **high-end restaurants**, the price for a single meal could **exceed a day’s salary**. So dining out can be either **cheap and cheerful** or **a real splurge**.

**5️⃣ What’s the difference between Chinese and Western food?**
The biggest difference lies in **cooking methods and ingredients**. Chinese cuisine relies heavily on **stir-frying** and **seasoning with soy sauce and spices**, while Western dishes often use **baking, grilling, or roasting**. Also, pork is a staple in Chinese food, whereas in some Western or Muslim regions, people prefer beef or lamb. The **flavour profiles** are completely different, but both are delicious in their own way.

**Key Vocabulary & Collocations:**
safe and predictable • open-minded and adventurous • symbol of Western lifestyle • social aspect • unwind • cheap and cheerful • real splurge • stir-frying • flavour profile • take the lead in the kitchen
