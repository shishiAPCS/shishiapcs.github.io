## Reading

### Graduate Study Lounge Now Open to All Students 
The university has decided to change its policy about Perkins Lounge. Previously, this study space was reserved for graduate students, but the university will now allow undergraduates to use Perkins Lounge as well. The Dean of Students explained: “The space is underutilized right now—there aren't a lot of graduate students making use of it—so there's room to allow additional students.” She also noted that the university has a problem with insufficient study space for undergraduates, since undergraduate enrollment at the university has increased in the last few years.

## Listening

Male student: Hey did you see this?
Female student: Yeah, I was a little disappointed.
Male student: Well, it's true that there really aren't a lot of grads students in there.
Female student: I know, but I just don't see why that's a bad thing, I think it’s perfect the way it is now.
Male student: Oh, why is that?
Female student: Well, I mean the fact that it's never packed. That's exactly why we like it, it's a quiet space to sit and think, and it really nice to have a place to spread out our books on the table. Especially when we are working on research projects.
Male student: That's true, yeah.
Female student: And since we have a lot of work as graduate students, it's really nice for us to have a space that isn’t noisy and crowded.
Male student: Yeah, and if they do this, it won't be that way anymore. In all fairness though, the undergrads do need somewhere to go, right. Especially since they are more of them now than there used to be.
Female student: I know I just feel like to really address that problem, the university should designate extra places for them specifically.
Male student: Like where?
Female student: Well, I know they're building a new dormitory, so maybe they could add a study space for them there and that way they can leave this one just for us.
Male student: Hey, that's a pretty good idea.

She appreciates that it’s </span>a quiet space <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>to </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>where graduate students can </span>sit and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>sink. When they want to do some </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>think, especially when working on </span>research <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>and work, they can have a space to spread their books.

She <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>thinks this is good. Because of the increased number of the graduate students, she thinks </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>believes that </span>if <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>they really need a space, </span>the university <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>can add a </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>wants to address the need for more </span>study <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>space.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>spaces for students, they could build additional spaces, like in the new dormitory they are constructing, instead of changing this one.</span></p>

However, she also acknowledges that undergraduates need a </span>place to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>work on their a research project but also </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>study and suggests that the university should create additional study spaces specifically </span>for <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>them, perhaps in </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>fairness and those students need somewhere to go as the girl says and the girl thing </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>new dormitory </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>do need some extra space for example like this group has making a new geometry and this would be a better place to go.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>are building.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>Speaking, I want </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The university has decided </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>disappoint you </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>open Perkins Lounge, which was previously only for graduate students, </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>have </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>undergraduates as well. The woman is disappointed by this decision because she values </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>sheer point </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>quiet and less crowded environment </span>of the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>program </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lounge, which is perfect for studying and working on research projects. She believes that allowing undergraduates in will make it noisy and crowded, which is not ideal for graduate students who need a peaceful place to study. She suggests that the university should create new study spaces specifically for undergraduates, like </span>in the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>print case the launch and the dimensions to the reasons why. And my first reason is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>new dormitory being built, so </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>because of, if there are also lots of underground students, the laboratories and some resource is difficult to spread out.

And the signal reason is that because the service is noisy and clouded, there is the other place like the new tombs, to have the extra points to study.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>graduate students.</span></p>

<p>The university plans to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>let a large </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>open the </span>graduate study <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>launch now opens </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lounge </span>to all <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>students. So, undergrad students can </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>students, allowing undergraduates to </span>use it as a study space <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>due to the lack of room for them. The woman feels disappointed about this change </span>because <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>of </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>she appreciates that </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>insufficient room. And in the destiny, the romantic experience of statement was </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lounge is usually quiet and </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>serious, serious, very disappointed. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>great place for graduate students to concentrate without noise. </span>She <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>thinks it is a very quiet space and the students can do reasons of just there's no noise. But </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>worries that </span>if <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the policy opens this space to all students, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>undergraduates start using it, </span>it will become <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>crowded and </span>noisy. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>So, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>To solve the issue of study space for undergraduates, </span>she suggests that <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the university could create additional study areas </span>in <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>order to address this problem, we can use extra spaces like </span>the new dormitories <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>they are building, </span>so <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>students </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the lounge </span>can <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>study there.

<p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>So, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The </span>university <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>has </span>decided to open <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the </span>graduate study lounge <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>for </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>to </span>all students. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>There are two students, firstly, there are a lot of all </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Currently, not many </span>graduate students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>who </span>are using <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>study place, but more, there is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the lounge, so there’s </span>an <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>inspiration study space for undergraduate students. And since this year, there are more enrollment for undergraduate students. And in </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>opportunity to allow undergraduates to use it too. In </span>the conversation, the two students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>feel disappointed </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>express disappointment </span>about <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>it. Because </span>this <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>graduate study lounge are </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>change. They enjoy the </span>quiet <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>because there are only fewer people in there. And it's like to spirit their bulk out to do </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>atmosphere of the lounge, which helps them focus on </span>their research <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>project.

If </span>too many <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>undergraduate students, they will </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>undergraduates start using the space, it may </span>become <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>very noisy. And they think </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>noisy and crowded. They believe the </span>university should <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>give extra places like building near </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>create additional study spaces specifically for undergraduates, perhaps </span>by <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>adding one to </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>dorm, to give the undergraduate students to study.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>new dormitory that’s being built.</span></p>

<p>The <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>user later says that even </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>university has decided to allow </span>undergraduate students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>have a right </span>to use <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Perkins Lounge, which was previously reserved for graduate students. The woman in the conversation agrees with this change, but she expresses concern </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>space. And </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>it might make </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>university has </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lounge crowded and noisy.

And this woman agrees with </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>for undergraduates, she suggests </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>student because she thinks that it's really a nice place to read books or do the project because that place is not noisy and not crowded. And she says </span>the university should <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>provide extra place </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>create additional study areas specifically </span>for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>undergraduate students.

<p><strong>August</strong></p>
<p>The plan is to <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>open the </span>graduate study <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lunch with open </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lounge </span>to all students, not <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>only graduated students, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>just graduate students </span>but also <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>undergraduates. The woman disagrees with this plan for a couple of reasons. First, she believes that if too many </span>undergraduate students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>as well. And since there's not </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>start using the lounge, it will no longer be </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lot of graduate students and there's not enough space for undergraduate students and the women disagree with this plan. Here are two reasons she gave. The first reason is if there are too many students, if the undergraduate students come to that lunch, the lunch wouldn't be </span>quiet and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>not crowded anymore since there are more students in that space. So the more undergraduate students may study environments </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>peaceful place </span>for graduate students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>would become worse. The second reason is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>to study. Second, she thinks that </span>to really <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>address </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>solve </span>the problem <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>that there's </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>of </span>not <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>having </span>enough <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>study </span>space for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>undergraduate students </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>undergraduates, the university should create additional study areas specifically for them in a different building, like the new dormitory </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>can choose another building to study.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>are constructing.</span></p>

<p>In the reading passage, the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>students such as the </span>university <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>should </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>has decided to </span>open the graduate study <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>large </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lounge to undergraduate students </span>because <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>of students.

For instance, she mentions that it's </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the lounge is </span>a perfect <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>place, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>space for graduate students </span>because <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>it's really </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>it is </span>quiet, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>especially </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>which is important </span>for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>sometimes like students need to do some </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>doing </span>research <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>project.

<p>In the reading, the university <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>allows </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>has decided to allow </span>undergraduate students to use <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the pay-in-longs </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Perkins Lounge </span>as well. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>And in order </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>This change is intended </span>to create <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>a </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>more </span>study space for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the undergraduate students, but </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>undergraduates. However, </span>in the lecture, the woman <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is a point </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>expresses her disagreement </span>with this <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>suggestion, and she thinks </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>plan. She believes </span>it's a bad <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>thing that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>idea </span>because the graduate students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>before can have </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>previously enjoyed </span>a quiet space to study and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>to put the books and separates the books and researchers some information. And now, there are lots of undergraduate students. It well lets this space be more noise and the crowd eat. It's not good things for some undergraduate students to study. And there will be </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>spread out their books. With </span>more undergraduate students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>than before. So, if this </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>coming in, she worries that the lounge will become noisy and crowded, which isn't good for studying. She suggests that the </span>university <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>only addresses problems they need </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>should find other ways </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>some actual...</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>address the space issue without taking away the quiet environment that graduate students need.</span></p>

<p>The university announced that the graduate study <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>launch </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lounge is </span>now <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>opened </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>open </span>to all <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>students to give the undergraduate students a study room for them </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>students, allowing undergraduates </span>to use <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>and make </span>the <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>space, which aims to address the need for more </span>study <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>place more sufficient. But </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>areas. However, </span>the woman <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>disagree </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>disagrees </span>with this <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>policy. Because </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>policy because </span>she <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>thought </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>values </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>study launch is acquired space and the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lounge as a quiet place where graduate </span>students can spread out <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the books on the table. But </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>their books. She worries that </span>if <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the undergraduate students </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>undergraduates </span>join in, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>maybe </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>launch </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lounge </span>will <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>be </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>become </span>noisy and crowded. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>And </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>She suggests that to really solve </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>woman gives a plan to make give </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>problem of study space for undergraduates, </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>extra place for the undergraduate </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>university should create additional study areas, </span>like <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>in </span>the new <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>dormant hurry is a good place for them. So now the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>dormitory they are building. This way, both </span>undergraduate and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the </span>graduate students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>all </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>can </span>have <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the good </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>suitable </span>study <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>place for them to study.

The woman expresses her opinion that this change is not a good idea because she values the quiet atmosphere of the lounge, which is currently a great space for graduate students to study and work on research projects without distractions. She suggests that the university should create separate study spaces for undergraduates instead.</span></p>

<p>The university announced that the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>parking lot was just </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Perkins Lounge is now </span>open to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the </span>undergraduate students because graduate students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>doesn't </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>don’t </span>use <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>that place as euro, as their expats, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>it much, </span>and the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>undergraduate students' </span>number <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>will increase. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>of undergraduates has increased. </span>However, the graduate student <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>doesn't agree </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>disagrees </span>with <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>that suggestion. The first point is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>this plan. She points out </span>that graduate students like <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>that place </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the lounge </span>because <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>it's </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>it’s </span>quiet, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>so they can just </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>allowing them to </span>spread out <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>their </span>books <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>in </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>on </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>table, especially do some research, but if it's open </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>table and work on research projects. If the lounge is opened up </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>undergraduate students, they </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>undergraduates, she worries it </span>will <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>be </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>become </span>noisy and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>grouted. The second point is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>crowded. She suggests </span>that if the university really wants to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>solve that question, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>address </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>university </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>issue of space for undergraduates, they </span>should <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>just give some extra place to their undergraduate students. It just likes </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>create additional study areas specifically for them, like adding a study space in </span>the new <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>dorm, the dorm, it's a good place to undergraduate students.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>dormitory that is being built.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>In the last turn, the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The </span>university <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>wanted </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>has decided </span>to open <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the Perkins Lounge to undergraduate students because it is currently underutilized by </span>graduate <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>students along because one reason is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>students. The female student expresses her disappointment about </span>this <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>language is not used frequently. Second, on the graduate students studied in sufficient. And in the conversation, the graduate students, women students are disappointed because before the policy they have applied place and they </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>change, as she appreciates having a quiet space where she </span>can spread out <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>her </span>books <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>on </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>and work without distractions. She believes that </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>table and also are nice to sync scenes to syncing and not be disturbed. And also, the women students give a proposal that </span>university should <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>add extra </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>create additional </span>study <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>places not to occupy graduated students places. And she thinks that new </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>spaces for undergraduates, perhaps by adding </span>study <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>places should set </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>areas </span>in the new dormitory <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>and it's more convenient to </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>they are building, so that </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>students live here.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Perkins Lounge can remain a quiet place for graduate students.</span></p>

<p>The announcement is about <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the parking sludge is allowed for the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>allowing </span>undergraduate students to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>provide a sufficient study place </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>use Perkins Lounge, which was previously reserved </span>for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>them. But the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>graduate students. The </span>woman <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>was </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>is </span>disappointed with this <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>announcement. First, she thinks </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>change. She believes </span>it's not a good idea because <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the parking lounge </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Perkins Lounge </span>is a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>very </span>quiet <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>place </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>space </span>for graduate students to study and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>put </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>spread </span>out their books, especially when <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>working on research projects. She worries that if undergraduates are allowed in, the space will become noisy and crowded. Instead, she thinks the university should create a new study space for undergraduates in the new dormitory </span>they are <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>doing researchers. And if the undergraduate are allowed to get into the parking sludge, they will make the space very noise and crowded. And this woman thinks the best way to solve this problem is to change </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>building, so that Perkins Lounge can remain </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>new dorm-tory room into a study place </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>quiet area </span>for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>undergraduate </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>graduate </span>students.</p>

<p>In this lecture, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>it starts about school design to </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the university announced that the Perkins Lounge, which was previously reserved for </span>graduate <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>students long </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>students, is </span>now open to all <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>students. They think </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>students, including undergraduates. The Dean of Students mentioned that </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>first reason </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lounge is underutilized by graduate students, so they have decided to allow undergraduates to use it as well. </span>

<span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The woman expresses her opinion </span>that <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>this change is not a good idea. She believes the lounge is perfect as it is because it is quiet and not crowded, which makes it a great place for graduate students to study and work on research projects. She worries that if undergraduates start using the space, it will become noisy and crowded. Instead, she suggests that the university should create additional study spaces specifically for undergraduates, perhaps </span>in the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>past it just worked for the graduate student not for the undergraduate students for use. The reason is that they have enough say set to allow the undergraduate students to come in the second reason that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>new dormitory </span>they are <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>in for the student space for the undergraduate with and enrolls the graduate students last. The goal is to agree with this opinion she said </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>building, so </span>that the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>space at the past, the space is really </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Perkins Lounge can remain a </span>quiet <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>and it's a nice space to take a book or study, a self study. The way it comes to the undergraduate students will be crowd and not quiet. And the second opinion she thinks that the school can give the new domain names </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>area </span>for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the undergraduate </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>graduate </span>students.</p>

<p>The <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>University </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>university has decided to change its policy regarding the use </span>of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the University </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Perkins Lounge. Previously, this space was only for graduate students, but now undergraduates </span>will <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>change the policy about using these places. In the past, the University has not </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>also be </span>allowed <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the ungraduated students </span>to use <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>this person. Now it has changed their rules. Also, there are also some problems in efficient study places. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>it. </span>The woman in the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lesson is disappointing. This </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>conversation expresses disappointment about this change. She believes that Perkins Lounge </span>is a quiet <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>and nice </span>place <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>and a nice place. There </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>to study, which </span>is <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>why graduate students appreciate it. It's </span>not noisy <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>and crowded. So </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>or crowded, making it ideal for focusing on their work. She thinks that instead of opening this space to undergraduates, </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>place is best to use it. In her opinion, it is...</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>university should create additional study areas specifically for them, especially since they have increased in number.</span></p>

In </span>the listening, the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>woman's singing </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>woman expresses her disappointment about this change. She thinks it's a bad idea because the lounge </span>is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>really disappointed. It's not </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>perfect as it is now for graduate students. She mentions that it’s </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>good idea. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>quiet space where they can spread out their books and work on research projects without distractions. </span>She <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>believes it's perfect now. She announced </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>worries </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>they graduate students have a phrase to put all things out on the desk. And the space is quite... is quite... And after the whole open to all students, there </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>if undergraduates start using it, it </span>will <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>be </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>become </span>noisy and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>bad environment. And she </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>crowded. She </span>also <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>says </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>suggests </span>that <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the </span>university should create <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>some extra plays such as </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>additional study spaces for undergraduates, like adding a study area in the </span>new <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>dormitory, use </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>dormitory they are building, so that </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>space here.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Perkins Lounge can remain a quiet place for graduate students.</span></p>

<p>The proposal is about the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>universities prepared to ask the undergraduate student use the longjews which can only the graduate student use in the past. And the first is it can allow more additional students use because there has less less </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>university allowing </span>undergraduate students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>there. Secondly, it </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>to use Perkins Lounge, which was previously reserved only for graduate students. The Dean of Students mentioned that the lounge </span>is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>in efficient studies based </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>underutilized, meaning there aren't many graduate students using it, so there's room </span>for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>undergraduate </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>more </span>students. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>As a woman in </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>In </span>the conversation, <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the woman expresses her opinion against </span>this <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is the way that. Firstly, she think the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>change. She feels that </span>more people in the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>longjews, they were more noisy will be make. So </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lounge would make it noisier, which would disrupt the quiet atmosphere that graduate students appreciate. She also suggests that instead of opening </span>this <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is well less quiet </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>space to undergraduates, the university should create additional study areas specifically for them, perhaps </span>in the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>longjews. Secondly, she think it can address the problem and school shoots prepare the extra place for the undergraduate students such as.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>new dormitory they are building.</span></p>

This change </span>is <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>happening because there has been </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>university decided to let the undergraduate student join </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>significant increase </span>in the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>self-study room that used to just for the graduate student since the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>number of </span>undergraduate <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>student are increasing a lot </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>students </span>this year. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>And the woman </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The female </span>student <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>was very </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>is </span>upset about this <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>change </span>because she <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>seems </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>believes </span>that the atmosphere in the graduate <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>students self-study </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>students' study </span>room <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>was very quiet </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>is quiet, which helps them focus </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>this will help them to have </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>work well. She feels that if </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>good environment to study and work. And seeing this </span>lot of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>undergraduate students join in, this cannot keep </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>undergraduates join, </span>it <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>any more. And she seems </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>will no longer be a peaceful environment.

<p>In the reading material, we <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>can know </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>learn </span>that the university <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>decided to </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>has changed its policy regarding Perkins Lounge. Previously, this space was only available for graduate students, but now undergraduates can use it too. The woman disagrees with this </span>change <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>policy or policy about </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>because she values Perkins Lounge as a quiet study space. She mentions that it is not crowded, which makes it ideal for graduate students who need a peaceful environment for their research projects. She feels that if undergraduates are allowed in, it will become noisy and lose its appeal. Instead, she suggests that </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>Pangle loans. That's in the past, this place is just allowed a graduate student to use, but </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>university should create separate study spaces specifically for undergraduates, possibly </span>in the new <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>policy, we </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>dormitory they are building, so that graduate students </span>can <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>know that the university decided </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>continue </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>allow the own graduate student to use to. The Oman totalities agree with these opinions, choosing that is very required place when </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>enjoy Perkins Lounge as </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lot of ungraduated school come here. It's a good place </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>quiet area </span>for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>a graduate student to research some information or research some other things to finish </span>their <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>project or do other things to study. But if they allow the ungraduated student to come here, this place is very noisy, not quite the same as before. She is in ungraduated and go to the new place and to find a place to work and study, so she disagrees with opinions in total.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>work.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>about </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The university is changing its policy </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>change the police </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>allow undergraduates </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>make some undergraduate to not </span>use <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>these specific locations because there's no not efficient sufficient space </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Perkins Lounge, which was previously reserved </span>for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>study and for </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>graduate </span>students. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>And </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The woman </span>in the listening <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>material, this woman that speaking is agree </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>material agrees </span>with this <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>segment because he's saying this location </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>change, but she expresses concern that it might make the space noisy and crowded, which </span>is <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>not ideal for graduate students who need </span>a quiet <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>space pass. It is very good </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>place to work on research projects. She suggests that instead of allowing undergraduates </span>to use <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>to work to do some research projects and to work together. But now if </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>this space, </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>undergraduate come here, it would be noisy and prodded.

So the utilities could address these problems that provide another space </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>areas specifically for them, </span>like in <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>dormitories rather than these locations that it would better address.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the new dormitory they are building. This way, graduate students can continue to have a quiet environment for their studies.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>According to the reading passage, the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The </span>university <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>has </span>decided to open <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Perkins Lounge, which was previously reserved for graduate students, to undergraduates as well. The Dean of Students mentioned that </span>the <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lounge is underutilized by </span>graduate <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>students, allowing the university to accommodate more students. However, the female </span>student <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lab for two reasons. Firstly, it can increase </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>in </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>utility of it. Secondly, it provides additional space for students to study. But however, according to </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>conversation strongly disagrees with this decision. She points out that </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>conversation, the girls strongly disagree with the idea for two reasons. For one thing, she mentions that before the operation, the space </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lounge </span>is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>very </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>currently a </span>quiet and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>not crowded, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>uncrowded space, </span>which <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>means it's a good place </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>is ideal </span>for <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>graduate </span>students to think and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>work. And it's benefit for them to finish some </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>work on their </span>assignments, especially <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>for the </span>research projects. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>But however, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>She fears that allowing undergraduates will disrupt this peaceful environment. Instead of opening Perkins Lounge to everyone, she suggests that </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>space is broken after </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>university should create additional study spaces specifically for undergraduates, perhaps in </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>operation. Secondly, she mentions that if </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>new dormitory they are building, to maintain </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>student wants to solve the problem, they can explore the dorm space </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>quiet atmosphere of Perkins Lounge </span>for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>students to study.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>graduate students.</span></p>

<p>The university announced that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>not </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the Perkins Lounge, which was previously </span>only <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>for </span>graduate <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>students can use the loans, but </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>students, will now </span>also <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>be open to </span>undergraduate <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>students can also use the loans because </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>students. The Dean mentioned that </span>not many graduate students use the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>loans </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lounge, </span>and there is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>insufficient </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>not enough study </span>space for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>undergraduate students </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>undergraduates. The female student feels disappointed about this change because she appreciates the quiet atmosphere of the lounge, which allows her </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>study. In </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>focus on her work. She likes having a space where she can spread out her books while working on research projects. She worries that if undergraduates start using </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lesson in materials, the undergraduate students are disappointed because the first students, the loans, are quiet space for them to study. And when she is doing a project, she likes to spread their books in the tables. If the undergraduate students also use the loans, the loans can be very </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lounge, it will become </span>crowded and <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>noisy, which would affect her study environment. She suggests that the </span>university <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>can give them.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>should create additional study spaces specifically for undergraduates to solve this problem.</span></p>

<p>The proposal <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>says </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>states that </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>University Officer Plan </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>university plans </span>to open the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>space </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Perkins Lounge, </span>which <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>previous </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>was previously reserved </span>only for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>undergraduate students now open </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>graduate students, </span>to all <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>of </span>students. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>And because </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The Dean mentioned </span>that <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the </span>space is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>under utilized </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>underutilized </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>it definitely </span>can <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>adomitate </span>accommodate <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>additional students and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>more students. However, </span>the woman <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>totally disagree </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>disagrees </span>with <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>this plan. She believes that having fewer students in </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>students. She don't believe it's </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lounge makes it </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>great idea. And so when it's the fewer students, she believes she knows that is very </span>quiet and cozy space for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>our </span>graduate students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>for study and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>to study, where </span>they can spread out their <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>books and the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>books. She also thinks that </span>graduate <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>student </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>students </span>have other <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>place </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>places </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>go.
