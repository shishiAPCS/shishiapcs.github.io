# Task4
## Using points and examples from the lecture, explain two ways people account for inappropriate behavior.


## Listening

Generally, of course, we want other people to think well of us, we want others to see us as good people. As people who know how to behave appropriately. But being human, we all occasionally behaved inappropriately, do something we shouldn't do. And when that happens, we often come up with explanations for our inappropriate behavior. So that others won’t think we are foolish or rude or irresponsible.
Let’s look at a couple of different ways people explain or account for inappropriate behavior. One way to account for inappropriate behavior is to attribute it to something beyond our control, this type of explanation is called an excuse. With excuses, we acknowledged that our behavior with inappropriate, but claimed that we didn't intend to behave that way, that our inappropriate behavior was due to events or circumstances beyond our control. As a professor, I hear excuses all the time, for example, when students arelate to class, a classic excuse is that they overslept, because their alarm clock didn't go off. They didn’t mean to come to class late, but something beyond their control, went wrong with their alarm clock and that's why they didn't wake up on time and were late.
Another way, we sometimes explain inappropriate behavior, so that others don't think badly of us, is by utilizing what's called a justification. When we use a justification, we explain that we intentionally did something that would normally be inappropriate, but that was okay this time because we had a good reason for behaving the way we did. I also often hear justifications, when students explain why they missed class, for example, they say they missed the class because they had a very important job interview at same time as the class. So, they chose to miss the class, but they justify itby explaining that they had to go to an important job interview.

For instance, a student might say </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>may explain that is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>missed class because they had </span>a very important job interview <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>so </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>at the same time. This way, </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>cannot go to class.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>justify their absence by emphasizing the importance of the interview.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>George</strong></p>
<p>The professor talked about how people account for their inappropriate <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>behavior. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>behavior in two main ways. </span>First, people <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>would </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>often </span>attribute <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>it </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>their behavior </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the </span>factors that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>out of our </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>are </span>beyond <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>our control, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>their control </span>and make <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>excuse </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>excuses </span>for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>some hard circumstance. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>difficult circumstances. </span>For example, if <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the students </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>a student is </span>late <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>for the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>to </span>class, they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>can attribute </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>might say </span>it <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>to some factor that that student can control and attribute it to their wake up late. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>was because they overslept, which is something they couldn't control. </span>Second, people <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>would make some adjustments for </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>use justifications to explain </span>their inappropriate behavior. They <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>will </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>try to </span>make their <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>behavior </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>actions seem </span>reasonable. For <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>example, students can </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>instance, a student might </span>say they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>have </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>missed class because they had a </span>very important <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>interview. So, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>job interview at the same time. In this case, </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>late for the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>are justifying their choice to skip </span>class.</p>

<p>The lecture <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>were </span>talked about two ways that people <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>use to </span>make excuses for their inappropriate behavior to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>make others </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>create </span>a good <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>impression on themselves. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>impression. </span>One <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>specific </span>way is to explain <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the </span>circumstances beyond their control. For example, students who <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>are </span>late for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>class, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>class might say </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>explain </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>overslept because </span>their <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>overstep because the </span>alarm didn't <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>work well. The </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>go off. This </span>situation is not in their control. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>Another </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The second </span>way is called <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>justification, where people explain that they did something inappropriate intentionally but had a good reason for it. For instance, a student might miss class because they had a very important job interview at </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>justification that people are explaining </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>same time. They justify their choice </span>by saying that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>they are doing intentionally, for example, </span>the job interview <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>students choose to instead of</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>was a priority.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>The never-fraised-fraited behaviour is, we </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>We </span>all <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>always </span>want <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>all the </span>people to see us as good <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>people, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>individuals, </span>so when we make mistakes, we <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>think of some </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>often come up with </span>explanations. The first <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>way to explain inappropriate behavior </span>is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>called, excuse that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>called an excuse, which is when </span>we <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>explain </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>attribute our actions to </span>something <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>that is </span>beyond our control. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>Like, for </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>For </span>example, <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>if </span>a student <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>laid </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>is late </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the </span>class, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>and he explained, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>they might say it’s </span>because <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>he obviously, because his </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>their alarm </span>clock <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>didn't work, something like that, the things beyond </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>didn’t go off. They didn’t mean to be late; it was just an unfortunate circumstance. </span>

<span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The second way we explain </span>our <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>control. And the second is, just vacation, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>behavior is through justification. This is when we acknowledge </span>that we <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>have some </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>did something inappropriate but believe we had a </span>good <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>reasons to explain, like </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>reason for it. For instance, if </span>a student <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>laid to the class, and he explained, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>misses class </span>because <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>he had a very </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>they have an </span>important job interview at the same time, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>so he </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>they might justify their absence by saying that the interview was a priority. In this case, they </span>chose to go to the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>interview, but now I go to the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>interview instead of attending </span>class.</p>

<p><strong>Zao</strong></p>
<p>From the psychology lecture, we know that people really want <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>others </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>other </span>think <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>way </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>well </span>of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>us, but </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>us. However, </span>when we do something <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>inappropriate, </span>we <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>shouldn't do, we will have some explanation </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>often come up with explanations </span>for our <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>inappropriate behaviors, and there </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>behavior. There </span>are two <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>main </span>ways people <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>can't follow the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>account for their </span>inappropriate <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>behaviors. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>actions. </span>The first is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the attributes. Just like people will find some excuse </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>by making excuses. For example, if a student is late </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>explain their behaviors and the professor give an example is that if students late, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>class, </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>will </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>might </span>say they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>are over-sliped, and they will find other reasons </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>overslept because their alarm clock didn’t go off. This excuse suggests </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is clock didn't get off. So the excuse stands </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>their lateness was due </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>think </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>circumstances </span>beyond their <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>control, and secondly </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>control. The second way </span>is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>other </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>through </span>justifications. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>Also, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>For instance, </span>if <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the students miss </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>a student misses </span>a class, they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>will say </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>might explain that </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>will attend </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>had </span>an important job <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>interview. So, there is a lot </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>interview at the same time. They justify their absence by emphasizing the significance </span>of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>other people choosing </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the interview, making it seem acceptable </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>do.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>miss class.</span></p>

<p><strong>Steven</strong></p>
<p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>Come here, people hope that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>People want </span>others <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>to </span>think <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>we are good people and we just </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>well of them, so when they </span>do something <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>we should do and sometimes we make explanation that don't let others think we are </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>inappropriate, they often come up with explanations to avoid being seen as </span>foolish or <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>rude and the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>rude. The </span>first <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>one </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>way to explain inappropriate behavior </span>is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>excuse </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>through an excuse, which is when we say </span>that something <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>behind </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>beyond </span>our control <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the professor gave </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>caused our actions. For example, professors often hear students say they were late to class because their alarm clock didn't go off. They didn't mean to be late; it was just </span>an <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>example as </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>unfortunate circumstance. </span>

<span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The second way to explain inappropriate behavior is through justification. This is when we acknowledge that our actions were inappropriate but argue that we had </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>professor some student late for the class and they have a choice that they said they slept for a long time and they forgot to go to the class room and the second one is justification people make </span>good reason for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>example, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>doing them. For instance, </span>students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>expand why they missed the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>might miss </span>class <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>and the reason is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>because </span>they have an important job interview <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>so they choose </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>at the same time. They justify their absence by explaining that the opportunity was too important </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>miss the class</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>pass up.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>He is a lectures is mentioned to </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>In </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>idea of the imposure 8 and the first way for the people accounts for the importance of the behavior is the beyond the control and the theory is the example of </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lecture, </span>the professor <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>professor, how to help the cause, but he forget to bring his computer snap that this is important to the behavior to make the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>discussed two ways </span>people account for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>them. As </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>inappropriate behavior. The first way is through excuses, where individuals attribute their actions to circumstances beyond their control. For example, if a student is late to class, they might say they overslept because their alarm didn't go off. They acknowledge their behavior was inappropriate but claim it was unintentional due to </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>second, these are excuse </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>situation. </span>

<span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The second way is justifications, where people explain that their inappropriate behavior was acceptable because they had a good reason. For instance, a student might miss class for an important job interview and justify their absence by saying that </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>vacation, just vacation, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>interview was a priority. Both excuses </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>we should have the good rating to make others</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>justifications help people manage how others perceive their actions.</span></p>

<p><strong>Leon</strong></p>
<p>We <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>all </span>want <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>you all </span>to <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>be seen as good people, but sometimes we behave inappropriately. When that happens, we often come up with explanations so others don’t think we’re foolish. There are two main ways we do this. First, we use excuses. For example, if a student is late to class, they might </span>say <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>as </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>their alarm didn’t go off. This shows they didn’t mean to be late; it was something out of their control. Second, we use justifications. This is when we explain that we intentionally did something inappropriate, but we had </span>a good <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>person </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>reason. For instance, a student might miss class because they had a job interview at the same time, </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>sometimes we shouldn't do and we will give some explanation that don't let somebody feel as a foolishness. So this will cause </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>they justify it by saying </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>inappropriate behaviors and here are two kinds of behaviors. First it's about we gave the excuse and the excuse course like the student gave the reason why they're late and so the professor may just understand it and second is about the just fake. If the student made some certain kind of things so they will explain why they do this and tell them to the professor.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>interview was very important.</span></p>

<p><strong>Tina</strong></p>
<p>In the last year, the professor talked about <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>when he </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>how people </span>sometimes <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>he was missing in property through something. They have some foolish explanations in many ways. First, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>make excuses for their inappropriate behavior. One way </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>will contribute </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>do this is by attributing their actions to </span>something beyond <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>or control them. Many students like to have an excuse. It is not in turn to be that way. It is such a being culture. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>their control. </span>For example, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>when </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>many </span>students <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>say they </span>are late to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>class, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>class because their alarm didn't go off, which is an excuse that suggests </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>will say </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>didn't mean to be late. The second way people account for inappropriate behavior is through justifications. This means they explain their actions by saying they had a good reason for behaving </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>they are not long or they don't know it's time to go to school. And secondly, that justification. This intention is sound like more properly </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>way. For instance, students might miss class </span>because <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>they are good-readers. I also, for example, when students meet the class, they will say that </span>they have an important job <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>interview </span>at the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>set time.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>same time, and they justify their absence by emphasizing the significance of the interview.</span></p>

<p><strong>Andy</strong></p>
<p>When people <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>do some inappropriate behavior, you already people will just </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>behave inappropriately, others might </span>think <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>that </span>they are foolish <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>and they are just </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>or </span>not <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>really </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>very </span>smart. However, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>sometimes </span>people <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>will just </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>often </span>explain <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>this behavior, that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>their behavior to make </span>it <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>doesn't </span>seem <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>to impropriate. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>less inappropriate. </span>The first <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>point </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>way </span>is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>that if </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>by attributing their actions to </span>something <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is </span>beyond their <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>control, then people will think that it is appropriate behavior. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>control. </span>For example, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the professor that has </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>if </span>a student <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>just a date, belating the class, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>is late to class </span>because their <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>alarm </span>clock <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is starting to ring. So that happens that beyond the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>didn't go off, they can say it was out of their </span>control. The second <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>point </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>way </span>is <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>through justifications, where they explain </span>that <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>they had a good reason for their behavior. For instance, a student might miss class because they had an important job interview at the same time, and they justify </span>it <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>adds just vacation, because there is some reason to do </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>by saying that </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>no-morsing. For example, the student needs to go to the job so that he is...</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>interview was necessary.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>The inner preparation </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>People often account for inappropriate </span>behavior <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is the behavior that they use. They use some excuse to get some, for some reasons. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>in two main ways: by using excuses and justifications. </span>For example, <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>when students are late to class, they might say their alarm clock didn't go off. This is an excuse, as they acknowledge their behavior was inappropriate but claim it was beyond their control. Another way is through justifications. For instance, some students miss class because they have an important job interview at </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>professor discuss an example of </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>same time. They justify </span>their <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>class. She often hears some excuse, because from </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>absence by explaining that attending </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>students, they often say that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>interview was necessary for </span>their <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>clocks are broken, so they can't wake up. Also, they use justifications. They have very important meetings, so they choose to attend this class.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>future.</span></p>

<p>The <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lecture, the professor saying </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lecture explains </span>that people have two ways to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>explain what </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>account for </span>their <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>appropriate behavior is. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>inappropriate behavior. </span>The first <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>way </span>is <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>to </span>attribute <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>something beyond control that calls excuse. It means due </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>it </span>to something beyond <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>their </span>control, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>so </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>which is called an excuse. This means </span>that they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>do this behavior. The </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>acknowledge their behavior was inappropriate but claim it was due to circumstances they couldn't control. For example, the </span>professor <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>giving an example of </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>mentioned </span>students who <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>relate </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>are late </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the lecture. The students said </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>class because </span>their alarm <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>did </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>didn't </span>go <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>wrong. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>off. They didn’t mean to be late; something beyond their control caused it. </span>The second <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>way </span>is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>attribute adjustification. It </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>through justification. This </span>means <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>that </span>students intentionally do <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>this behavior, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>something that is normally inappropriate </span>but <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>believe it's acceptable because </span>they have <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>another more important thing, such that at this time, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>a good reason. For instance, </span>when students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>meet the lectures, they have more </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>miss class for an </span>important job interview <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>happening </span>at the same <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>time.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>time, they justify their absence by stating that the interview was more important.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>The either lecture </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>In the lecture, we talked </span>about <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>that, the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>how </span>people <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>are currently in the apportion behavior, that people have some behavior that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>account for inappropriate behavior. One way </span>is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>in poverty, they do something not to do, like do something in the flesh, slash, and one of them is that, beyond control, it </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>by using excuses. This </span>means that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>do </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>when someone does </span>something <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>inappropriate, they might say it was beyond their control. For example, if a student </span>is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>clues or excuse </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>late </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>do something, do something not to encode enough, I'll have an example of that, a lost class, the professor, have a class, the people we call late, on the second example, and the second one is that, they have a distract, this text, a faction, and this means that, they have an example of that, the professor asks students why they come to school, why they come to this </span>class, they <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>might </span>say <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>their alarm didn't go off, which is an excuse because </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>have another </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>didn't intend to be late. </span>

<span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Another way people explain their behavior is through justifications. This happens when someone admits they did something inappropriate but believes it was okay because they had a good reason. For instance, a student might miss class because they had an </span>important job <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>interview </span>at the same <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>time, so </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>time. They justify their absence by explaining </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>means that's it.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the interview was more important.</span></p>

<p><strong>Eric</strong></p>
<p>In <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the last thing, we know that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>general, </span>people <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>or ones that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>want </span>others <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>to </span>have a positive <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>comment for themselves. If </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>view of them, especially when </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>have to do some improper scenes, they will have some </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>behave inappropriately. They often find </span>ways to <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>explain their actions to </span>avoid <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>that the people have a </span>negative <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>comment for them. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>judgments. </span>The first <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>way </span>is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>a excuse. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>through excuses. </span>For example, if a student <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>leads the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>is late to </span>class, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>maybe he will </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>they might </span>say <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>it was because </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>are not listening to the noises. And for the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>couldn't hear their alarm clock. The </span>second way is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>as an adjective with catations. So it means, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>through justifications. For instance, if a student misses class, they might explain that they had a job interview at the same time, which they felt was a valid reason </span>for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>example, if the students are not coming for this class, he will say they have job interviews.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>missing class.</span></p>

<p><strong>Joyce</strong></p>
<p>In the lecture, the professor explains two ways that people account for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>appropriate </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>inappropriate </span>behavior. The first way is to attribute <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>their actions </span>to something <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>beyond. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>beyond their control. </span>For instance, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the </span>students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>are afraid </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>might say they were late </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>do the </span>class <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>because they overslept, </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>actually </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>don't </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>didn't </span>mean to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>that but </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>be late; </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>maybe give some reason why they didn't wake up </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>might blame it </span>on <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the time. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>their alarm clock not going off. </span>The second way is <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>through justifications. For example, if </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>jacked-to-fication. Like if the students just missed the class and he or she will </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>student misses class, they might </span>explain that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>there's an important job in there and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>they had </span>an important job interview at the same <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>time. That's why they missed </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>time as </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>class because </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>class. They justify their absence by saying that </span>the job interview <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>was </span>more important than <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the classes.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>attending class.</span></p>

<p><strong>Michael</strong></p>
<p>In the lecture, the professor <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>gave us two examples to explain </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>explained </span>two ways people account for inappropriate <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>behaviors. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>behavior. </span>The first <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>way </span>is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>by attributing their actions to </span>something beyond <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the people's </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>their </span>control, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>that's they may make the inappropriate behavior. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>which we call an excuse. </span>For example, if a student <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>comes </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>arrives late </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>classroom late and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>class, they might say it was because their alarm didn't go off. They didn't intend to be late; it was just an unfortunate circumstance. The second way is through justifications, where people explain that they intentionally did something inappropriate but had a good reason for it. For instance, if a student misses class because they have an important job interview at </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>reasons is not caused </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>same time, they might justify their absence </span>by <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>saying that the interview was crucial for </span>their <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>own, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>future. So, these </span>are <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>caused by the alarm's not work, so get updates. It's a professor who forgives him. And the second account for inappropriate behavior is that people have another important project or sense they need to do. Also, in the students come late in the classrooms. If the students have another important project, they must do it in this day. So they can't forgive to come late in the classrooms. And the professor will forgive them. So there's </span>two ways people account for <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>their </span>inappropriate behavior.</p>

<p><strong>Alice</strong></p>
<p>In the lecture, the professor explained two ways people account for inappropriate behavior. The first <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>way </span>is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>by making excuses, where people try to explain their behavior by saying it was out of their control. For example, a student might say they were late to class because their alarm clock didn’t go off, implying they didn’t mean </span>to be <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>on </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>late. The second way is through justifications, where people provide reasons for their actions that make them seem acceptable. For instance, a student might miss class because they had an important job interview at </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>control the ex-cuse, they find some excuse </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>same time, </span>and they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>don't want other people to think badly of themselves. And also, they beyond </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>justify their absence by saying that </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>day can control this. And also, secondly, they use the justified justification. They have good reasons and the behavior they try to date. For example, like some students, they just missed class and they will justify that they have more important jobs so that they miss the class. So this is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>interview was necessary. So, these are </span>the two <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>way </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>ways </span>the professor <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>mentioned it.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>mentioned: excuses and justifications.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Selina</strong></p>
<p>The professor <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>gives to behaviors to explain that the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>explains two ways </span>people <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>become more foolish and inappropriate. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>account for their inappropriate behavior. </span>The first <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>behavior </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>way </span>is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>excuse. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>through excuses. </span>When <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the </span>people <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>become inappropriate, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>behave inappropriately, </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>have the best </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>might say it was </span>beyond <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>our </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>their </span>control. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>There is an </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>For </span>example, if <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>a </span>student <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>laid the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>is late to </span>class, they might <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>say they overslept because their alarm didn't go off. They didn't mean to </span>be <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>late; it was just something that went wrong. The second way is through justifications. This is when someone explains that their behavior, even if it seems inappropriate, was okay this time </span>because they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>wrong. And they missed alarm, so they went to the classroom and laid the class. The second example, the second behavior is the justification, which the people </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>had a good reason. For instance, a student </span>might <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>think is normally and it is okay this time, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>miss class </span>because they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>have the good reason to solve this problem. The professor gives </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>had </span>an <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>example about if the teacher thinks why the student missed the class. Maybe the student will answer that they have the </span>important job <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>and this thing it is okay to miss </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>interview at the same time. They justify </span>their <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>class.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>absence by saying that the job interview was necessary.</span></p>

<p><strong>Claire</strong></p>
<p>This <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>topic </span>is <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>about how people explain their inappropriate behavior, especially in </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>literature about the psychological </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>school setting. First, one way people explain their actions is by saying </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>people have some behavior and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>something beyond their control happened. For example, if a </span>student <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>groups, so </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>is late because </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>need to explain the problems while this happens. And first, you have the first thing you need to think about the experience beyond these actual things. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>overslept, they might say their alarm didn’t go off. </span>They <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>can control about this. So </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>acknowledge that being late is inappropriate, but </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>just give us an example about it. They can, they must speak when they are over sleep, so the parents need to be on </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>claim it wasn’t </span>their <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>floor so they can control the ones on their bed. So this is the first. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>fault. </span>The second <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>way people explain their behavior </span>is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the gestivation, the patient. This is okay for these things. And also, keep asking them all about the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>through justifications. For instance, a </span>student <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>missing class. So </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>might miss class because </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>just need to </span>have <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the most </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>an </span>important job <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>in </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>interview at </span>the same time. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>So they don't go up, so they just want to do it.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>They justify their choice by explaining that the interview was necessary, even though it meant missing class.</span></p>

<p><strong>Tom</strong></p>
<p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>The queue waits for people </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>People often try </span>to explain <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>their inappropriate behavior to avoid looking foolish. One way they do this is by making excuses. For example, if a student is late to class, they might say it was because their alarm didn't go off. This shows that they didn't intend to be late, and it was something beyond their control. Another way people explain their behavior is through justifications. This means they acknowledge that </span>what they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>do that is improperly and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>did was inappropriate but believe </span>it <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is foolish. Firstly, people will attribute these events beyond control that makes such </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>was acceptable in their situation. For instance, </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>excuse. For example, the excuse that is due to the circumstance, for example, the students is made. So, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>student might miss class because </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>will have </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>had </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>excuse that they have a lawyer's parking in the wrong. That is beyond for his control. As a second, people will give the certification. That is, maybe it's normal and it's okay. And this reason is okay, for example. If students missed the course, they may have the reason that they have an important </span>job <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>interview </span>at the same <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>time. To </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>time, and they </span>justify <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>these reasons that have seen times </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>this by saying it was an </span>important <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>jobs, just instead of this.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>opportunity. Both excuses and justifications help people explain their actions to others.</span></p>

<p>According to the lecture, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>some </span>people <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>will </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>often </span>explain their bad behaviors <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>in order </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>avoid some people to have some negative expression to ask </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>prevent others from thinking negatively about </span>them. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>And here </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>There </span>are two <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>main </span>methods <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>they use </span>for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>them to explain. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>this. </span>The first <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>strategy </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>method </span>is called <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>an </span>excuse, which means <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>that </span>when <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>a situation </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>something </span>is out of <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>their </span>control, they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>will </span>find <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the excuse </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>a reason </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>explain. They will say do not intend to do it, but situation happens. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>explain their behavior. </span>For example, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>some people are </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>if someone is </span>late, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>so </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>will find excuse that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>might say </span>their <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>alarm </span>clock <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>do not </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>didn't </span>go off, which <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>means </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>explains why </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>will come late. So </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>arrived late to class. The second method is called justification. In this case, people acknowledge that </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>are late for the class. Secondly, it's called justification, which means when </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>did something inappropriate but explain that it was acceptable because </span>the situation <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is not like the normal situation, some people will not do as they are intended. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>was unusual. </span>For <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>example, some people will </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>instance, a student might </span>miss <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the </span>class because they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>have </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>had a </span>very important job <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>interview.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>interview at the same time, and they justify their absence by saying that the interview was a priority.</span></p>

<p><strong>Isaiah</strong></p>
<p>In <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the </span>lecture, the professor mentioned that people <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>always found </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>often find </span>explanations <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>to </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>for </span>their <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>improper </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>inappropriate </span>behavior. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>And the professor claims the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>He talked about </span>two types of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the explanation. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>explanations. </span>The first <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>type </span>is called <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the X-Cue. It </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>an excuse, which </span>means <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>that </span>something is beyond <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>true people's </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>a person's </span>control. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>So, like the professor used the students' examples. Some students, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>For example, </span>when <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>students' </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>students are </span>late, they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>always said the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>might say their alarm </span>clock <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>didn't work. So, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>didn’t go off, which is why </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>overslapped. And the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>overslept. The </span>second type is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>called a </span>justification. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>People </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>This is when people </span>intentionally do <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>something inappropriate but believe it’s okay because they have a good reason. For instance, students might miss class because they have an important job interview at </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>things. But this is okay. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>same time. </span>They <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>have practical reasons. Because, like </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>justify their absence by saying that attending </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>Miss class.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>interview was necessary.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>If </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>In </span>this lecture, the professor <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is talking </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>talks </span>about two methods <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>people use </span>to respond to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>your </span>inappropriate behavior. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>And so the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The </span>first <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>way is, excuse, the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>method is called an excuse. An </span>excuse means <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>there's </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>that there is </span>something beyond <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>or controlled due to </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>our control that caused the behavior, like </span>certain circumstances. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>And </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>For instance, </span>the professor gave <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>us </span>a common example <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>about the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>where a student is late to class because their </span>alarm <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>didn't always lay too close to the alarm because the alarm </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>clock </span>didn't go off. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>And it's </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>This is </span>a reasonable <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>reason </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>explanation </span>for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the professor. And the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>being late. The </span>second method is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>a </span>justification. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>So the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>In this case, </span>students intentionally make <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the wrong </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>a </span>decision <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>because </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>that might be seen as wrong, but </span>they have a good <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>reason. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>reason for it. </span>For example, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>they didn't come to </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>a student might miss </span>class because they have a job interview at the same time. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>So it </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>This </span>justifies <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the reason why he came late.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>their absence.</span></p>

<p><strong>Jason</strong></p>
<p>In the lecture, the professor <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>says that in common situation the person long </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>talks about how people want </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>think will thus so will behave appropriately </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>be seen as behaving appropriately, </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>we will </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>when they act inappropriately, they often </span>come <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>of some explanation to attributes to the reason why I do this things. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>up with explanations. </span>The first <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>way to explain inappropriate behavior </span>is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>its cues. It </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>through excuses. For example, students might say they are late to class because their alarm clock didn't go off. They acknowledge that being late </span>is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>advanced in certain sense just like the students get late for classes. There are some situations </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>not ideal, but they claim it was </span>beyond <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>alarm clock. So the students will say very politely to the students. And the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>their control. The </span>second <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>way </span>is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>a justification. It </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>justifications. This </span>is <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>when someone explains that their inappropriate action was </span>okay <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>to say some good reasons just like the students says he </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>because they </span>had a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>very </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>good reason. For instance, a student might say they missed class because they had an </span>important job <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>so he had to go for </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>interview at </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>job that's ways out.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>same time. They justify their choice by emphasizing the importance of the interview.</span></p>

<p><strong>Raymond</strong></p>
<p>In the lecture, the professor <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>introduced us in appropriate </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>talked about inappropriate </span>behavior <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>and how </span>people <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>always </span>want <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>other CS </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>to be seen </span>as good <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>people. People always make mistakes so that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>individuals. Everyone makes mistakes, and when </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>will </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>do, they </span>try to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>appropriate behavior. Otherwise, other way of seeing that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>explain their behavior so others don’t think </span>they are <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>foolish or fool. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>foolish. </span>The first <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>example </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>way people account for their inappropriate behavior </span>is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>about, excuse </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>through excuses. For example, when students are late to class, they often say it’s because their alarm didn’t go off, suggesting </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>people always say there are something </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>it was </span>beyond their <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>control </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>control. The second way is through justifications. This is when people explain </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the example is about a student's late-floor class and they will always say </span>their <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>alarm do not work but not their own mistakes. And the second example is about justification that people will say it's okay for </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>inappropriate behavior was acceptable </span>this time because they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>will have </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>had a </span>good <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>subjects. The example is about students who </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>reason. For instance, a student might </span>say they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>are late </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>missed </span>class <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>by not </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>because they had </span>an important <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>job interview at the same time. They justify their absence by saying that the interview was a valid reason to miss </span>class.</p>

<p><strong>Lauren</strong></p>
<p>The professor <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>used </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>explained </span>two ways <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>to illustrate how </span>people <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>use some ways to </span>account for inappropriate <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>behaviors. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>behavior. </span>The first way is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>to give some special cues for the person, why there is some un-countrued happens. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>by using excuses. </span>For example, if <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>one </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>a </span>student <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>played for class and he explained for </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>is late to class, they might say their alarm clock broke, which makes </span>the professor <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>that his clock get break and that's why he overslept and his professor will feel better. And secondly, it's adjusting of vacations. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>more understanding. </span>The <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>first </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>second </span>way <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>for example, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>is through justifications. For instance, </span>if <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>there are students meet the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>a student misses </span>class <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>and he told the professor that he has </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>because they had </span>a very important <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>job, must to do during </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>job interview at </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>class. So he meets </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>same time, they can explain that they had a good reason for missing it. This helps </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>class.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>professor see that the student made a choice based on their situation.</span></p>

<p><strong>Meredith</strong></p>
<p>The lecture <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is talking about </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>discusses </span>two ways that people <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>are examined </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>account </span>for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the improper behavior and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>inappropriate behavior. The </span>first <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>wise, well, the excuse. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>way is through excuses. </span>When <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>people have </span>something <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>out of their control on them, happen on them. And they didn't intend to make mistakes. They will use the excuse. And the examiner is about the professor who has a student which is a slave-fork class. And he explains </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>happens </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>because he's almost broken and everything </span>is out of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>his </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>a person's control, they might use an excuse. For example, if a student is late to class, they might say it’s because their alarm didn’t go off. They didn’t intend to be late; it was just something beyond their </span>control. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>And </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The </span>second <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>wise, about the justification. It </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>way is through justifications. This </span>means that people <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>may </span>do <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>this mistake for some </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>something inappropriate but feel they have a </span>good reason <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>to do that. And </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>for it. For instance, a student might miss class because they have an important job interview at </span>the same <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>example, some students are a mis-search class. And he will give a reason about it because he has a very important job interview. And he thinks </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>time. They justify their choice by saying </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>this </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the interview </span>was more important than <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the class. So he chose to...</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>attending class.</span></p>
