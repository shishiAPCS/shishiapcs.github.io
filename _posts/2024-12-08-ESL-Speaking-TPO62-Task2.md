# Task2
## The woman disagrees with the parking lot proposal presented in the university paper. Explain the proposal and the reasons the woman gives for opposing it.


## Reading

New Parking Lot Location 
I was very pleased to read about the university's plans to build a new parking lot to accommodate the growing number of student cars on campus. Since the location for the new lot has not yet been determined, I would like to suggest that Sanders Field be used. Sanders Field has not been used for sports events since the new stadium was built two years ago. Right now, it is wasted space, so it would be an ideal area to turn into something useful like a parking lot. Students who live in the dorms really need a place to park their cars. Students living off campus could really use the extra parking, too.
Sincerely,
Jason Hill

## Listening

Now listen to two students discussing the letter. Did you see Jason's letter in the paper? What do you think? I think he's wrong. I feel it is useful to students. It's used all the time. To speak as it isn't used for sports anymore, doesn't mean it's useless. Plenty of people go there to relax or study and stuff, don't you? Yeah, sometimes. I think students who live in the nearby dorms hang out there a lot. It's a nice spot. That's what I'm saying. And it's great to just have an open area like that, some place you can study outside or take a nap or whatever. We don't have enough places like that on campus. I don't want to see it covered over with pavement and a bunch of cars. Guess it would be kind of a shame. And I don't believe what he says about needing it either. What do you mean? It's right next to all the dorms. But there's already enough parking in every dorm, and those lots are never full as it is. True. But some students commute and... Most of them would rather park in the lots that are closer to the classroom buildings. It's at least a fifteen-minute walk from Sander's Field. Yeah, it's not that close to the main part of campus.

She mentions </span>that, although <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>using the park </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>it is not used for sports anymore, many </span>students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>can take a walk </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>go there to relax </span>or <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>take a horse after the dinner, but in this lecture, the women think </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>study outside. She feels </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>in this university, they already have the sports center, so they don't need to go outside. And although the park students can study outside, but the women think it doesn't need to do the things. They have the classroom and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>having an open area like Sanders Field is important for students, especially since there are not many places on campus where </span>they can <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>study the classroom or library. And the second written is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>do that. Additionally, she argues </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>it's about the car parking. And the women didn't like that the students take a park car in the parking. So, because </span>the university already <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>have </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>has sufficient parking available near </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>place to park </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>dorms, so there is no need for a new parking lot. Overall, she thinks that converting </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>car.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>field into a parking lot would take away a valuable space for students.</span></p>

<p>In the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>destiny </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>reading </span>passage, a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>student's </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>student named </span>Jason suggests that <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the </span>university should turn <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the center field </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Sanders Field </span>into a new parking lot because it is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the west of the place </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>currently unused </span>and many students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>have cars to park </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>need parking </span>near the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>dorms to need it. In </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>dorms. However, in </span>the lecture, the woman disagrees with this <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>idea, she thinks </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>idea. She believes </span>that the field is <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>actually </span>used <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>for </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>by </span>students for sports <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>and as a place to relax </span>or <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>hanging out. In the campus, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>study. She points out that </span>there <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>are not </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>aren’t </span>many areas <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>of this, of areas to </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>on campus where students can </span>study <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>outside </span>or <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lookbook. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>just hang out. </span>Finally, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>it is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>she argues that </span>not all <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the </span>students need parking <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>since there are already parking lots close to the dorms, </span>and <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>walking from Sanders Field to </span>the classroom <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>building is close to their dorms, so it just several minutes work.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>buildings would take about fifteen minutes.</span></p>

<p>The <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>artist could talk </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>proposal is </span>about <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>building a </span>new parking lot <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>location. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>at the university, and </span>Jason suggests <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>using Sanders Field for this purpose. He believes </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the sun field should be used. It is a waste idea area for the past. He thinks it can be used to be parking. Parking card should be </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>since Sanders Field hasn’t been </span>used for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>people. But </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>sports since the new stadium was built, it is wasted space and could be turned into a parking lot. He argues that students living in the dorms and those who commute need more parking options. However, the woman </span>in the listening <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>passage, the woman </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>passage disagrees with this proposal. She feels that Sanders Field </span>is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>described as parking lot proposal. Because she thinks it doesn't mean the empathy area is used as. It's </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>actually </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>good place </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>valuable space </span>for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>people </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>students </span>to relax and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>stuff. And it is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>study. She points out that it’s </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>very </span>nice open <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>area. People can study outside. And </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>area, and it would be a shame to cover it with cars. Additionally, </span>she <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>thinks </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>mentions that </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>campus between the is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>parking lot would be </span>too far <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>away. It </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>from the main part of campus, as it </span>takes <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>about </span>15 <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>minutes, so it's not close </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>minutes </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the campus.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>walk there.</span></p>

<p>In a letter, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the standard field has </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Jason suggests using Sanders Field for a new parking lot because it hasn't </span>been <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>not </span>used for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the </span>sports <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>and it's sometimes because </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>since </span>the new <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>studios building build </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>stadium was built. He believes it would be helpful for students who need parking. However, the woman disagrees with him. She argues that Sanders Field is actually useful for students who want to relax or study outside. She points out that many students enjoy that space, </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>then </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>there is already enough parking near </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>new of </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>dorms. She thinks that turning </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>area. The standard area has been determined to fill </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>field into </span>a parking <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lot. The parking lots can have more space </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lot would take away a valuable area </span>for students to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>park their lots and it's very useful. But the woman against her ideas is because this is the setting field is also useful because of the students can get relaxed and study for their. This is really to go outside there and also if he thought that the students can park in their cars, the nearest is classroom buildings and not just in the fields. The fields can for students to study and relax and it is not needed for students to do that.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>enjoy.</span></p>

<p>The <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>woman's sink </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>woman disagrees with the proposal for a new parking lot at Sanders Field. She believes that Sanders Field </span>is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>roaming </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>actually a useful space </span>for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>anything, anyone, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>students, as many use it to relax or study. She argues that just because it isn't used for sports anymore doesn't mean it's useless. Additionally, she mentions that there are already enough parking spaces near </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>boy something that you the the local for new lot less not in that trick first letter yet the woman is a great woman's sink is bad yes so the woman is a great this is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>dorms, and students would prefer to park closer to their classes rather than walk from </span>a parking lot <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>drugs one so recently the university except its graves now from smizz moving from going three</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>that is fifteen minutes away.</span></p>

<p>In the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lecture, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>letter, </span>the writer <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>think </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>supports </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>university </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>university's </span>plan to build <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>a </span>new <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>park is a very good choice because </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>parking lot, arguing that </span>it <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>can make </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>will help </span>students <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>by providing </span>more <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>healthy </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>parking space </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>they can get exercise in the new park and the student can use the extract parking and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>encouraging them to be more active. However, </span>the woman <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>disagrees with this proposal. She believes that Sanders Field, where the parking lot </span>is <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>proposed, is actually </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>degree </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>valuable space for students to relax and study. She mentions that many students use Sanders Field for activities other than sports, and it would be a shame to cover it </span>with <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>pavement and cars. Additionally, she points out that there is already enough </span>parking <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>a lot of per person person telling </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>available near </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>university paper</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>dorms, making the need for more parking less urgent.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>Then he is very grateful to read about </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The writer expresses gratitude for </span>the university's plans <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>about building </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>to build </span>a new parking lot to accommodate the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>growing numbers </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>increasing number </span>of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>students, cars, and camp suits. And he </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>student cars. He </span>suggests that <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Sanders Field be used for this purpose since it hasn't been utilized for sports events since </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>centers will be used. And </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>new stadium was built. However, </span>the woman <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>thing </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>disagrees with this proposal. She argues that Sanders Field </span>is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>wrong because it's </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>actually </span>useful for students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>all the time. It doesn't mean that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>because </span>it <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>doesn't mean that it is unuseful.

She emphasizes that just because it’s not used for sports anymore doesn’t mean it should be turned into a parking lot. Additionally, she points out that many students prefer to park in lots closer to their classes, and Sanders Field is quite a distance from </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>students can study outside and take a nap. It is a place </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>main campus, making it less convenient </span>for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>students to study outside and take a nap.

<p><strong>Alexander</strong></p>
<p>The <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>man is mentioned that in </span>article <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>he thinks it can, the university campus can add the parking park, but in the lecture the woman thinks it's round decision and it's waste of, waste of </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>discusses </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lot of place and she thinks the place can, you can take a nap or do some exercise and take. Also, the university students should focus on the study and you can live near the university and so she thinks that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>proposal </span>to build a <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>new </span>parking <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lot on campus </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>stay car </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>accommodate more student cars. However, in the discussion, the woman disagrees with this idea. She believes that turning Sanders Field into a parking lot would be a poor decision because the space </span>is <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>currently used for relaxation and activities like studying or exercising. She argues that students living nearby often enjoy the open area, and it’s important for them to have </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>very rough decision and that's all.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>place to unwind. Additionally, she mentions that students who live close to campus already have sufficient parking available, so building a new lot may not be necessary. Overall, she feels that keeping Sanders Field as it is would be more beneficial for students.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>Also, we talk </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The proposal is </span>about <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the turns area </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>turning Sanders Field </span>into a new parking <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lot. But </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lot because the university wants to accommodate more student cars. However, the woman disagrees with </span>this <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>thing </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>idea. She believes that Sanders Field </span>is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>useless for them to just put it in </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>repetitive place. But they want to build an extra parking lot </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>valuable space </span>for students to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>better put their car in. But the woman disagree because this thing is easy </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>relax and study, and it’s used often </span>for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>users to relax such as students will place boarding it or studying it. And it's very nice area. And there's </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>those purposes. She argues that there’s </span>no need for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>them to build an extra </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>a new </span>parking lot <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>because </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>since there are already parking options available within a fifteen-minute walk from </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>new list </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>dorms. Therefore, she feels that converting Sanders Field into a </span>parking lot <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>are only need less than 15 minutes. So they can just put their car in it and walk to </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>would not be beneficial for </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>classroom.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>students.</span></p>

<p>The university <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>announcement then they will replace the failed for students into </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>announced plans to build </span>a new parking lot on <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>campus. And </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>campus to help accommodate the growing number of student cars. However, </span>the woman <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>really disagree </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>disagrees </span>with this <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>idea. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>proposal. </span>She <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>thinks this field </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>believes that Sanders Field </span>is <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>still </span>useful for students because <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>they can do some sport </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>it provides a space for physical activities </span>and <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>allows them to study outside. If this field </span>is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>great </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>turned into a parking lot, it could limit the opportunities </span>for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>students' physical health </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>students to engage in sports </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>students also can study outside on this field. If </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>enjoy </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>car, if they use this place to park in car, students </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>outdoor space. Additionally, she points out that there are already plenty of parking options available around campus, so there </span>may <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>all disagree with this idea. And students already parking </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>not be </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lot around campus so they don't </span>need <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>to have </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>for </span>a new parking lot. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>So the woman really disagree with this idea because </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Overall, </span>she thinks <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>it is harmful for students and they all wear this agree with this idea.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>that converting Sanders Field into a parking lot would be detrimental to the student community.</span></p>

<p>The woman <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>showed his disagreements </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>disagrees with the proposal </span>for the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>proposal from the debtor, and she </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>new parking lot. She </span>has <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>got </span>two <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>reasons. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>main reasons for her disagreement. </span>First, the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>place where </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>location suggested for </span>the <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>parking lot is Sanders Field. She argues that this area is not just wasted space; many </span>students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>mentioned that she wanted the university </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>use it </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>change </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>relax, study, or play sports. Therefore, converting </span>it into <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the parking place. Now, some students are going to studying or play basketball in there. So it's not a waste place. It do have some students need that. So if they're changing to </span>a parking <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>place, it's kind of </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lot would be a </span>shame. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>And another reason it has, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Second, she points out that </span>there are <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>also some </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>already several parking lots on campus, which means students have </span>other <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>options for </span>parking <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>place in the university. So students can easily park </span>their cars.</p>

<p>The <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>wider singe government show that her son fell into </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>proposal suggests building a new parking lot on Sanders Field because it hasn't been used for sports events since </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>door parking because this place didn't have </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>new stadium was built. However, </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>sport event and students in the dorms need the place to park the car. The </span>woman disagrees <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>with this idea. She argues that just </span>because <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>she said people don't use not </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the field isn't used for sports anymore doesn't </span>mean it's <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>useless. Some people also </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>useless; many students </span>go <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>there </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>their children and take a nap. Second, the sport, the sound field </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>relax or study. Additionally, she points out that Sanders Field </span>is far from the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>school. So </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>main part of campus, making it inconvenient for </span>students <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>living </span>in the dorms <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>are unveined </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>go </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>walk </span>there. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>Take </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Therefore, she believes it would be </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>part and go </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>mistake </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>school.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>turn that area into a parking lot.</span></p>

It was very appreciated to read about the university plan </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>proposal </span>to build a new <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>park, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>parking lot on Sanders Field. She argues that although the field is </span>not <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>currently used for sports, it serves as a valuable open space for students to relax, study, and socialize. She feels that turning it into a parking lot would take away a nice area on campus that students enjoy, especially since there are already parking spaces available near </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>architect's argument. The goal is to build a new park, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>dorms that are </span>not <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>a poor person in the university, but an academic argument.

The woman disagrees with this </span>decision <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>because, even though Sanders Field isn't used for sports anymore, it still provides a space for students to relax or study. She believes it would be a shame to turn </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the camera is made is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>area into a parking lot since it's a nice spot for students. Additionally, she points out </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>you tell </span>the parking lot <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>in </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>would be quite far from </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>center view which is used </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>main part of campus, making it inconvenient </span>for <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>students who need to walk </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>rest place and it doesn't have any sports player. And in the listening, a woman disagrees with that decision, facing that although it didn't have any sports use, but it can also provide a place for the student to relax or if the student wants to start the outline, additionally she thinks that although it's a good decision to turn the waste place to a parking lot but she didn't want to say that the place the student used to relax parking a lot of </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>long distance between their </span>cars and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>it takes a long time to work between the parking lots and the school.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>classes.</span></p>

<p>The woman <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>disagreed and had up sciences' opinions have children. First, those building </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>disagrees with </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>more </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>proposal to build a new </span>parking <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lots locations can help </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lot at Sanders Field. She believes that Sanders Field is actually a valuable space for </span>students to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>put </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>relax and study, even if it’s not used for sports anymore. She argues that turning it into a parking lot would take away a nice open area </span>on <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>campus. Also, she points out that </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>ocean and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>new parking lot would be too far from </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>cause of the campus. But </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>main buildings, making </span>it <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is not so meaningful and relaxed. Second, the parking, the parking is more further in the school's buildings. So, if you're building </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>inconvenient for students, as </span>it <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is not nearby </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>could take them about fifteen minutes </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>it and some students need to at least 15 men to do it.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>walk there.</span></p>

<p><strong>Nina</strong></p>
<p>The student proposed <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>that turn the area </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>turning Sanders Field </span>into a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>place for a sport, and he thinks </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>parking lot to accommodate more cars on campus. However, the woman disagrees with this idea. She believes </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>this area should be used for as the parking space, and should be pinned to this place into a sport place. The human is a great way to propose, because she thinks first </span>the field is still useful, even <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>if </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>though it’s not used for sports anymore. Many students use </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>elements </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>area to relax or study, and those living nearby often enjoy spending time there. She argues that it’s important to have open spaces like this on campus. Additionally, she points out that it takes about 15 minutes to walk from Sanders Field to the main part </span>of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>sport are not adopted anymore. The field is a place </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>campus, which makes it less convenient </span>for students who <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>relax themselves. Even the people living near by the door, living near by the park, usually </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>need </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>be held out by using this field. The students really need such a place like this for them to relax, to run, to study, and he also turns that, now it takes 15 minutes to turn a new </span>park <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>into a sport place, and they will take them for the sport.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>there.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The </span>article <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>adjacent missions that have </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>discusses the university's plan to build </span>a new <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>park have a </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>parking lot to accommodate the growing number of student cars. The proposed location for the parking lot is not yet determined, but the author suggests using Sanders Field, which hasn't been used for sports since the </span>new <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>park areas and he think it is very good because first is now it's not determined I locate a location to park park car the second the center field it's He's in it's how it </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>stadium was </span>built <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>a stadium </span>two years <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>ago, so But a lot of people not to do that not not to use that so it was the area So it's it's very good to can be used to park but in the conversation that girl this agrees she have some reasons she thinks Sports it very good and it's not used this and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>ago. They believe </span>this area is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>good </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>wasted space and could be turned into something useful, like a parking lot, especially for students living in dorms who need a place to park. </span>

<span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>However, in the conversation, the woman disagrees with this proposal. She argues that Sanders Field is still useful because many students go there to relax or study. She believes it’s a nice </span>open <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>Open this </span>area <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>and can help </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>that shouldn't be covered with pavement. Also, she points out that the parking lot would not be convenient for students since it is </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>can let </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>fifteen-minute walk from </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>person to go outside and she she also think the park car parking It's not neat Because it's not close to to building it well take 50 minutes to to go to class building The</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>main campus buildings.</span></p>

<p><strong>YukiYu</strong></p>
<p>The <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>paper, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>university proposal suggests using Sanders Field as a new parking lot because it has been unused for sports events since </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>trace such as </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>new stadium was built two years ago. The writer believes </span>this <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>university, to use </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>area is wasted space and that students living in </span>the <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>dorms need more </span>parking <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>to use </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>options. However, </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>center's field to be the parking location. Because </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>woman disagrees with </span>this <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>place is a wasted place. It's built for two years, but </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>idea. She argues that just because there are </span>no sports events <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>to be in there. And now, the students who live in dorms really need a place for them to park in.

However, </span>the woman <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is a great waste </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>disagrees with this </span>idea because she <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>believes that the area, which is currently not used for sports, is actually valuable. She points out that many students use this space to relax, study, or take naps. Therefore, she </span>thinks <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>this waste area was opening areas. So, people can, some </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>it shouldn't be turned into a parking lot since the existing parking lots near the dorms are often not full, and </span>students can <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>use this area's boards relaxed and hand out on it and also they can take a nap. So, she doesn't think it it should become extra parking and also some people often study in classroom so they didn't need </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>park closer </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>use a new parking lot to save the car.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>their classes.</span></p>

And this is close to the other building, and also is close to the campnage. So, women disagree with </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>nice open space that we need on campus. Furthermore, she points out that </span>the parking lot <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>proposal presented in </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>would be far from </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>university papers,</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>main buildings, which isn't convenient for students.</span></p>
