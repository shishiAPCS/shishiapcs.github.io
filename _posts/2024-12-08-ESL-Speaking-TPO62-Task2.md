# Task2
## The woman disagrees with the parking lot proposal presented in the university paper. Explain the proposal and the reasons the woman gives for opposing it.


## Reading

New Parking Lot Location 
I was very pleased to read about the university's plans to build a new parking lot to accommodate the growing number of student cars on campus. Since the location for the new lot has not yet been determined, I would like to suggest that Sanders Field be used. Sanders Field has not been used for sports events since the new stadium was built two years ago. Right now, it is wasted space, so it would be an ideal area to turn into something useful like a parking lot. Students who live in the dorms really need a place to park their cars. Students living off campus could really use the extra parking, too.
Sincerely,
Jason Hill

## Listening

Now listen to two students discussing the letter. Did you see Jason's letter in the paper? What do you think? I think he's wrong. I feel it is useful to students. It's used all the time. To speak as it isn't used for sports anymore, doesn't mean it's useless. Plenty of people go there to relax or study and stuff, don't you? Yeah, sometimes. I think students who live in the nearby dorms hang out there a lot. It's a nice spot. That's what I'm saying. And it's great to just have an open area like that, some place you can study outside or take a nap or whatever. We don't have enough places like that on campus. I don't want to see it covered over with pavement and a bunch of cars. Guess it would be kind of a shame. And I don't believe what he says about needing it either. What do you mean? It's right next to all the dorms. But there's already enough parking in every dorm, and those lots are never full as it is. True. But some students commute and... Most of them would rather park in the lots that are closer to the classroom buildings. It's at least a fifteen-minute walk from Sander's Field. Yeah, it's not that close to the main part of campus.

She feels </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>in this university, they already have the sports center, so they don't need to go outside.

<p>The <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>artist could talk </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>proposal is </span>about <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>building a </span>new parking lot <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>location. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>at the university, and </span>Jason suggests <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>using Sanders Field for this purpose. He believes </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the sun field should be used. It is a waste idea area for the past. He thinks it can be used to be parking. Parking card should be </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>since Sanders Field hasn’t been </span>used for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>people. But </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>sports since the new stadium was built, it is wasted space and could be turned into a parking lot. He argues that students living in the dorms and those who commute need more parking options. However, the woman </span>in the listening <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>passage, the woman </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>passage disagrees with this proposal. She feels that Sanders Field </span>is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>described as parking lot proposal. Because she thinks it doesn't mean the empathy area is used as. It's </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>actually </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>good place </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>valuable space </span>for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>people </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>students </span>to relax and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>stuff. And it is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>study. She points out that it’s </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>very </span>nice open <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>area. People can study outside. And </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>area, and it would be a shame to cover it with cars. Additionally, </span>she <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>thinks </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>mentions that </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>campus between the is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>parking lot would be </span>too far <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>away.

He believes it would be helpful for students who need parking. However, the woman disagrees with him. She argues that Sanders Field is actually useful for students who want to relax or study outside. She points out that many students enjoy that space, </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>then </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>there is already enough parking near </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>new of </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>dorms. She thinks that turning </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>area. The standard area has been determined to fill </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>field into </span>a parking <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lot. The parking lots can have more space </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lot would take away a valuable area </span>for students to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>park their lots and it's very useful. But the woman against her ideas is because this is the setting field is also useful because of the students can get relaxed and study for their. This is really to go outside there and also if he thought that the students can park in their cars, the nearest is classroom buildings and not just in the fields. The fields can for students to study and relax and it is not needed for students to do that.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>enjoy.</span></p>

Also, the university students should focus on the study and you can live near the university and so she thinks that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>proposal </span>to build a <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>new </span>parking <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lot on campus </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>stay car </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>accommodate more student cars.

She </span>has <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>got </span>two <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>reasons. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>main reasons for her disagreement. </span>First, the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>place where </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>location suggested for </span>the <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>parking lot is Sanders Field. She argues that this area is not just wasted space; many </span>students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>mentioned that she wanted the university </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>use it </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>change </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>relax, study, or play sports. Therefore, converting </span>it into <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the parking place. Now, some students are going to studying or play basketball in there. So it's not a waste place. It do have some students need that. So if they're changing to </span>a parking <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>place, it's kind of </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lot would be a </span>shame. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>And another reason it has, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Second, she points out that </span>there are <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>also some </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>already several parking lots on campus, which means students have </span>other <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>options for </span>parking <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>place in the university. So students can easily park </span>their cars.</p>

However, </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>sport event and students in the dorms need the place to park the car. The </span>woman disagrees <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>with this idea. She argues that just </span>because <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>she said people don't use not </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the field isn't used for sports anymore doesn't </span>mean it's <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>useless. Some people also </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>useless; many students </span>go <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>there </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>their children and take a nap. Second, the sport, the sound field </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>relax or study. Additionally, she points out that Sanders Field </span>is far from the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>school. So </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>main part of campus, making it inconvenient for </span>students <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>living </span>in the dorms <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>are unveined </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>go </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>walk </span>there. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>Take </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Therefore, she believes it would be </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>part and go </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>mistake </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>school.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>turn that area into a parking lot.</span></p>

She feels that turning it into a parking lot would take away a nice area on campus that students enjoy, especially since there are already parking spaces available near </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>architect's argument. The goal is to build a new park, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>dorms that are </span>not <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>a poor person in the university, but an academic argument.

The woman disagrees with this </span>decision <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>because, even though Sanders Field isn't used for sports anymore, it still provides a space for students to relax or study. She believes it would be a shame to turn </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the camera is made is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>area into a parking lot since it's a nice spot for students. Additionally, she points out </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>you tell </span>the parking lot <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>in </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>would be quite far from </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>center view which is used </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>main part of campus, making it inconvenient </span>for <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>students who need to walk </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>rest place and it doesn't have any sports player. And in the listening, a woman disagrees with that decision, facing that although it didn't have any sports use, but it can also provide a place for the student to relax or if the student wants to start the outline, additionally she thinks that although it's a good decision to turn the waste place to a parking lot but she didn't want to say that the place the student used to relax parking a lot of </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>long distance between their </span>cars and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>it takes a long time to work between the parking lots and the school.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>classes.</span></p>

<p>The woman <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>disagreed and had up sciences' opinions have children. First, those building </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>disagrees with </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>more </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>proposal to build a new </span>parking <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lots locations can help </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lot at Sanders Field. She believes that Sanders Field is actually a valuable space for </span>students to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>put </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>relax and study, even if it’s not used for sports anymore. She argues that turning it into a parking lot would take away a nice open area </span>on <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>campus. Also, she points out that </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>ocean and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>new parking lot would be too far from </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>cause of the campus. But </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>main buildings, making </span>it <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is not so meaningful and relaxed. Second, the parking, the parking is more further in the school's buildings. So, if you're building </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>inconvenient for students, as </span>it <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is not nearby </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>could take them about fifteen minutes </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>it and some students need to at least 15 men to do it.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>walk there.</span></p>

<p><strong>Nina</strong></p>
<p>The student proposed <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>that turn the area </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>turning Sanders Field </span>into a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>place for a sport, and he thinks </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>parking lot to accommodate more cars on campus. However, the woman disagrees with this idea. She believes </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>this area should be used for as the parking space, and should be pinned to this place into a sport place. The human is a great way to propose, because she thinks first </span>the field is still useful, even <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>if </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>though it’s not used for sports anymore. Many students use </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>elements </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>area to relax or study, and those living nearby often enjoy spending time there. She argues that it’s important to have open spaces like this on campus. Additionally, she points out that it takes about 15 minutes to walk from Sanders Field to the main part </span>of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>sport are not adopted anymore. The field is a place </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>campus, which makes it less convenient </span>for students who <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>relax themselves. Even the people living near by the door, living near by the park, usually </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>need </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>be held out by using this field. The students really need such a place like this for them to relax, to run, to study, and he also turns that, now it takes 15 minutes to turn a new </span>park <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>into a sport place, and they will take them for the sport.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>there.</span></p>

The proposed location for the parking lot is not yet determined, but the author suggests using Sanders Field, which hasn't been used for sports since the </span>new <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>park areas and he think it is very good because first is now it's not determined I locate a location to park park car the second the center field it's He's in it's how it </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>stadium was </span>built <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>a stadium </span>two years <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>ago, so But a lot of people not to do that not not to use that so it was the area So it's it's very good to can be used to park but in the conversation that girl this agrees she have some reasons she thinks Sports it very good and it's not used this and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>ago. They believe </span>this area is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>good </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>wasted space and could be turned into something useful, like a parking lot, especially for students living in dorms who need a place to park. </span>

<span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>However, in the conversation, the woman disagrees with this proposal. She argues that Sanders Field is still useful because many students go there to relax or study. She believes it’s a nice </span>open <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>Open this </span>area <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>and can help </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>that shouldn't be covered with pavement.

<p>The <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>paper, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>university proposal suggests using Sanders Field as a new parking lot because it has been unused for sports events since </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>trace such as </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>new stadium was built two years ago. The writer believes </span>this <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>university, to use </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>area is wasted space and that students living in </span>the <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>dorms need more </span>parking <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>to use </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>options. However, </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>center's field to be the parking location. Because </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>woman disagrees with </span>this <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>place is a wasted place. It's built for two years, but </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>idea. She argues that just because there are </span>no sports events <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>to be in there. And now, the students who live in dorms really need a place for them to park in. But for the woman, she disagrees with this suggestion because she thinks no sports events, not </span>doesn't mean <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>that it's </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the field is </span>useless. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>Also, people or </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Many </span>students and teachers <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>can be relaxed in here.

She also points out that </span>there <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>are other open areas.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>is already sufficient parking near the dorms and that students who commute would prefer parking lots closer to their classes.</span></p>

In </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lesson in material We are </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>listening material, </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>girl </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>woman </span>completely disagrees with the proposal <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>in two-dita </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>for two </span>reasons. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>First of </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>First, she argues </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>The sand or field </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Sanders Field </span>is not <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the useless place student now also relax or study there </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>useless; students often relax, study, </span>and hang out <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>there </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>there. If the field is turned into a parking lot, it would </span>take <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>a nap so if there's no Sand or field it will not be enough in </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>away an important space for those activities. Second, she believes </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>place and Actually the second is that the student now </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>students don’t </span>actually <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>don't </span>need <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>so much place to park </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>more parking because </span>they prefer to park <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>near </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>closer to </span>their <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>class place</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>classes, and there are already enough parking spaces available in the dorm lots.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>Nowadays, students' </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Students' </span>cars <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>grow the number of campus </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>are increasing on campus, </span>and the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>schools who want </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>university plans </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>use the place that be waste about two years ago, but </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>build a new parking lot. However, </span>the woman <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is a great waste </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>disagrees with this </span>idea because she <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>believes that the area, which is currently not used for sports, is actually valuable. She points out that many students use this space to relax, study, or take naps. Therefore, she </span>thinks <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>this waste area was opening areas. So, people can, some </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>it shouldn't be turned into a parking lot since the existing parking lots near the dorms are often not full, and </span>students can <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>use this area's boards relaxed and hand out on it and also they can take a nap. So, she doesn't think it it should become extra parking and also some people often study in classroom so they didn't need </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>park closer </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>use a new parking lot to save the car.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>their classes.</span></p>

<p>The <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>proposal is about building a </span>new parking <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lot locations, locations of </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lot, but </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>new lots has not yet </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>location hasn’t </span>been <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>determined, and the senders failed to be used. So, women disagree </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>decided yet. The woman disagrees </span>with this <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>idea </span>because <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>in </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>she believes Sanders Field should not be used for parking. She argues that </span>this <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>place, they can take </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>area is valuable for students who want to relax or study outside. Many students from the nearby dorms go there to hang out, and it provides </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>relax, and some students nearby their camp go to the... and some students study out, can take a rest in there. And this is close to the other building, and also is close to the campnage. So, women disagree with </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>nice open space that we need on campus. Furthermore, she points out that </span>the parking lot <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>proposal presented in </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>would be far from </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>university papers,</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>main buildings, which isn't convenient for students.</span></p>

<p>The writer <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>agrees that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>supports </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>school builds </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>idea of the university building </span>a new parking <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>because of </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lot due to </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>brewed </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>increasing </span>number of student cars on campus. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>And he also mentions </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>He suggests </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the center field doesn't be used and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Sanders Field, which </span>is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>a western space. The student is still </span>not <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>currently being </span>used for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>any </span>sports events, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>but </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>would be a good location for this parking lot because it is wasted space. However, </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>ULAN scene </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>woman disagrees with this proposal. She believes that Sanders Field </span>is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>wrong. Just in this space can be used </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>actually useful </span>for students <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>who want </span>to relax <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>or </span>study outside. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>And </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>She argues that </span>if <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>a parking lot is built there, </span>it <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>builds a parking, it must protect noisy </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>could create noise </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>influence students learning and</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>distractions that would affect students' learning.</span></p>
