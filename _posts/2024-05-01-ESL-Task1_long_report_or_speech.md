<td>A little bit myself, I think I prefer to give a speech in front of a large group of people because I think write a long report is a waste of time and also my my grammar is not really good, so there must have so many grammar mistakes and because and if If I have a speech in front of large groups so I can have more time I guess I can learn more other things about this major whatever what so I think I must give a speech</td>
<td>Personally, I prefer giving a speech in front of a large group of people rather than writing a long report. I find writing a lengthy report to be time-consuming, especially since my grammar skills are not very strong, leading to potential mistakes. Additionally, presenting a speech allows me more opportunities to learn about my field of study and engage with others, so I believe giving a speech is the better choice for me.</td>

<td>Well, if I'm given the choice of a school or work assignment, I would prefer to giving the speech in front of a large group of people because if I give the speech in front of a large group of people, maybe I can become more confident and this can help me to develop the speaking skills. For example, I have a friend, she used to be really shy and she even not dare to speak to the strangers, so she tried to give speech in front of people, then she gradually become more confident and now her speaking skill has improved a lot.</td>

<td>I prefer to write a long report because if I write a long report, Isabel can make more mistakes and to check them. But if I give a speech in front of a large group of people, I normally can't make a mistake. I just can't be the one. So if I write a long report, I can be more prepared and it will make others clearly understand what I mean. It also saves time and it's easier than the speech in front of a large group of people.</td>
<td>I prefer writing a long report because it allows me to review and correct any mistakes. When giving a speech in front of a large group, there's more pressure to not make mistakes. By writing a report, I can better prepare and ensure that others understand my ideas clearly. Additionally, it saves time and is less daunting than speaking in front of a large audience.</td>

<td>I prefer to write a long report. First of all, for me, giving a speech in front of a large group of people is too nervous. Like, I will feel very nervous and maybe I will forget a lot of details or good ideas about my speech. But for writing a long report, I can check the details again and again. And also, I can add some good ideas about the report even I didn't come up with the first time.</td>
<td>I would prefer to write a long report. Firstly, speaking in front of a large group makes me very nervous. I worry that I might forget important details or ideas during the speech. However, when writing a long report, I have the opportunity to review and revise the content multiple times. Additionally, I can incorporate new ideas into the report, even if they didn't initially occur to me.</td>

<td>to write a long report about that because first if we write it down and we can have more time to think about it and also we can have deeper expression about that and second we can have a review about our what we wrote before and also we can have more communicate about while we work about this assignment so according to that we can know that if we have a speech we will not have a this kind of ability to repeat what we learned or what we worry about so i prefer to choose a long report</td>
<td>I would prefer to write a long report because when we write things down, we have more time to think and express our ideas deeply. Additionally, we can review our work and communicate more effectively with others. This allows us to reinforce our learning and understanding compared to giving a speech where we may not have the opportunity to repeat or elaborate on our thoughts. So, my choice would be to write a long report.</td>

<td>I prefer to write a long report because I have a few reasons for it. First of all, if you want to give a speech in front of a large group, you also need to write long essays and you need to prepare to give a presentation for people. But if you only need to write a long report, you don't need to think about this. What's more, giving a speech to a large group of people is very embarrassing. I don't have the courage to do that, so I think I will choose to write a long report.</td>
<td>I prefer writing a long report for a few reasons. Firstly, when giving a speech to a large group, one must also write lengthy essays and prepare a presentation. However, with just a long report, there is less stress. Additionally, speaking in front of a large audience can be quite daunting and embarrassing. Personally, I lack the courage for such a task, so I would opt for writing a detailed report instead.</td>

<td>In my view, I prefer to write a long report in order to show the school's assignment situation for two reasons. Firstly, I think the long report shows more information about the worknet division because the long report with a lot of words can contain many information about one case and it shows overall aspects of the problem. Also, I think the report is more formula compared with the speech.</td>
<td>Personally, I would choose to write a long report for a school assignment. I believe that a detailed report provides a comprehensive overview of the topic. It allows for a thorough analysis of the issue at hand and presents a more structured and in-depth examination compared to a speech in front of a large audience.</td>

The first reason is if you're in a large group of people, you can learn more details about the work assignment, so you can learn others' ideas and provide yourself thinking. And the second reason is if you give a speech in front of a large group of people, you can find some wrong things in your ideas, and you can change it to get a better goal for your work.</td>

<td>I would prefer to write a long report of the schoolwork assignment. First, sometimes people will feel stressful to face a lot of people and to do the speech.

<td>In my opinion, I like to write a long report because I think writing a long report can have a great preparation for the project and can give the entire things that the students prepare. Second, writing a long report can prove that the students do a good job, but if students give a speech, they can use a short time to prepare.</td>
<td>Personally, I prefer writing a long report. I believe that writing a comprehensive report allows for thorough preparation for the project and ensures that all necessary information is included. Additionally, a well-written report can demonstrate the student's effort and dedication. On the other hand, giving a speech may require less preparation time, but it may not provide as much depth and detail as a written report.</td>

<td>I prefer to write a long report to the school, although the speech in front of a large group can make them emotional, moved, but in the long run, in the long time to write a report can let me detect more specifically to make sure there's no mistakes. And secondly, to those people who are shy like me, they are not good at giving a speech to the public, so it is a safe way to express our opinion.</td>

<td>I prefer to write long reports than give a speech in front of a large group of people. The first reason is that giving a speech also takes a long time to prepare, and you must try your best to avoid some situations that happen that affect badly. But writing a long report can give you time to revise your report and deal with your problems. So from time and dealing problems, I choose to write long reports.</td>

<td>So, I would prefer to give a speech in front of a large group of people, because for myself, I think I'm more good at giving a speech, because I'm outgoing, so my speech is not really bad. Instead of that, my writing is quite bad, so I will choose to give a speech. And the second reason is that if you need to write a long report to the people, I think if you write something, you will consider more than speaking, because speaking, you just need to speak, but if you're writing, you have so many resources, and think about the grammar, so that's all.</td>
