### Brand Revival 
Sometimes consumers begin to feel nostalgic about certain products from long ago. People become attracted to the products' old-fashioned or retro features. In a strategy called brand revival, companies decide to revive and market products that were discontinued years earlier. Brand revival usually involves redesigning products, with a combination of the old features that made them popular, and updated features that are more relevant and meet the standards of consumers today.

## Listening

So, here's an example of how this actually worked in the United States and Europe. Now you are a little too young to remember this brand. But many years ago, a car company became really popular because of these very small cars, these vehicles were cute and really sporty. In fact, lots of people drove them. After a number of years, however car style changed and cars became larger. Eventually, the company stopped making the small cars.
Well about ten years ago, the company decided to produce this type of car again. The company thought that the sporty look and itssmall size would be attractive to lots of people today, especially people living in cities. See this car drives through crowded city streets, easily and can be parked in pretty tight spaces. But the little cars from the past also used a lot of gasoline. Nowadays most consumers prefer cars with engines that are fuel efficient, right? So the company recognized this trend and redesigned the cars to have more efficient engines. The cars have the same cute sporty look, but this version uses less fuel. And in fact, they’ve become really popular with today’s model selling quite well.

For example, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>there was a </span>car company <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>that previously produced small cars, </span>which <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>has produced the small cars before and those cars are </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>were </span>very cute and sporty.

<p>The professor talks about <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the </span>brand <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>revival in that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>revival, which is when companies redesign products </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>redesign the products, to let the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>combine </span>old features <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>be two updates, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>with </span>new <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>features and the tractor </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>updates that attract </span>consumers. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>In the last name, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>For example, </span>the professor <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>gives example about the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>mentions a car </span>brand that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>produce cars. It is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>was </span>very popular many years ago because it <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>has very smooth </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>made cute </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>very cute cars, but </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>sporty small cars.

So they change, it rises, use more efficient agents. And you can use less fluid so it can be </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>same cute sporty look. This new version has become </span>very popular <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>now.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>and sells well today.</span></p>

There's an </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>newer features that meet today’s consumer needs. An </span>example <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>in </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>from </span>the lecture is about a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>company.

However, about ten years ago, they decided to make that small car </span>again. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>And it </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>This </span>attracted a lot of people because <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>it's </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>it’s </span>easier to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>use </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>drive </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>can find the </span>park <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>space </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>in tight spaces. Additionally, many consumers today prefer cars with smaller engines that are </span>more <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>easily. And the secret for example is some people want the not big engines and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>fuel-efficient, </span>so the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>cabinet used all </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>company updated </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>engines </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>car </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>replace </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>have a better engine while keeping its cute sporty look.

<p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>Friend </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Brand </span>revival is a strategy <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>where companies redesign and market products </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>we designed in </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>have old features to attract customers. This helps keep </span>the product <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>to make the product which have the old features attract customers. So the product can keep </span>popular <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>until now. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>today. </span>The professor <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>gives </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>gave </span>an example of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the car company. In the ancient times, the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>a </span>car company <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>produced </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>that used to make small, cute cars that many people loved. However, over time, car styles changed, and larger cars became more common, so the company stopped making the small cars. About ten years ago, they decided to bring back </span>the small cars because <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>they thought people in cities would like them. They made sure </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>car is very cute. So it attract </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>new version had </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lot </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>sporty look but also included fuel-efficient engines since most consumers prefer cars that use less gas now. This combination </span>of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>people. But from </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>old and new features has helped </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>time the car came larger, but the company still make the smaller cars. So it also attract more people. But now most of </span>cars <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>use the gasoline to produce. But the company think they have the fuel efficient, so they have to change the engine and use the less fuel to make the car popular until now.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>sell well today.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>The Brand-Battle, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Brand revival is when companies bring back products that were popular in the past but were discontinued. They redesign these products by combining the old features that people loved with new updates that meet today's standards. For example, the professor talked about a small car that was very popular many years ago. Over time, car styles changed, and the company stopped making those small cars. However, about ten years ago, they decided to bring back this small car because it would appeal to people living in cities who need a car that can easily navigate crowded streets and fit into tight parking spaces. They also updated the car to be more fuel-efficient, </span>which <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>means </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>is important to consumers today. This way, </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>in no-vose redesigning product with a combination </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>new version </span>of the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>old features. Also in the lecture, the professor mentioned </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>car keeps its cute </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>example </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>sporty look while being more practical </span>for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>this.

However, over time, car styles changed, </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>cooked. After changing this, small is given, products and small production. It's become more large and they don't make the small things. So after 10 years, this modesty is lots of people and it is to get the new place. So they also use the strategy, its name is Brand Arrow.
