### Cafe to be Built in Library
The university has decided to build a cafe in the basement of the library.The reason given for this new development is that university officials believe students will enjoy the convenience of being able to eat without having to leave the library. Students have often complained that their studies are disrupted because they must leave the library whenever they want to eat. Officials also believe that it will help make library study more productive if students have the opportunity to take short breaks in the cafe while they’re working. 
Sincerely, Justin Ruben

## Listening

Now listen to two students discussing the article in the newspaper. Female student: I don't like the university's plan. Male student: Really? Why not? Female student: Well, even though we won't have to leave the library, that's just the problem. Nobody's gonna feel like walking all the way over to the cafeteria, especially when the weather's bad. They'll just run down to the basement to eat. Male student: I don't understand. Isn't that a good thing? Female student: No, because in the library, they're just gonna serve a bunch of unhealthy snacks, sandwiches, sweets, and soda. So students will just eat junk. At least the cafeteria has some healthy food. Male student: Okay, I see what you mean. Yeah, I probably wouldn't walk over to the cafeteria either. Female student: And I think they're wrong about another thing. If I'm in the library and I know my friends are down in the basement chatting, I'm gonna be tempted to go down there and hang out with them. You know what I mean? I'm sure I'm not the only one who would be tempted to go down there and chat. How's anybody gonna concentrate on doing actual work? Male student: Yeah. Good point. This whole thing might backfire.

<p>The university plans to build a cafe in the basement of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>library. It is very </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the library, which seems </span>convenient for students <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>because they won’t have </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>eat without leaving the library. But </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>leave to eat. However, </span>the woman in the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lecture didn't like </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>discussion disagrees with </span>this <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>policy, because it is true </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>plan. She argues that </span>students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>don't want </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>are unlikely </span>to walk <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>over </span>to the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>cafeteria </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>cafeteria, especially in bad weather, and will instead rush to the cafe </span>in the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>bad weather. But the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>basement. The </span>problem is <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>that </span>the cafe <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>only provides junk food such as sandwich </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>will mostly serve unhealthy options like sandwiches </span>and soda, which <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is unhealthy </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>isn’t good </span>for students. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>Another question is, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Additionally, </span>if students know their friends are <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>cheating </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>hanging out </span>in the basement, they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>are </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>might be </span>tempted to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>hang out and chat with his friends. It is difficult </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>join them instead of focusing on their studies. This could make it harder </span>for students to concentrate and do <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>some researches.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>their research.</span></p>

<p>The woman in the conversation <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>doesn't </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>does not </span>like the <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>university's </span>plan <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>that decided by </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>to build a cafe in </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>university that built cave in a school's </span>library. First, she <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>claimed </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>believes </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>even though </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>while </span>it <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>doesn't feel good </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>may be convenient not </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>walk through the cafeteria and the library. But </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>leave </span>the library <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>just provides </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>for food, the cafe will </span>only <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>junk food for </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>serve unhealthy snacks, unlike the cafeteria, which offers healthier options. Second, she thinks that having a cafe in the basement could distract </span>students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>which is not as healthy as what cafeteria provides. Third second reason is that even though there's basement provided to students have breaks, it also can distract her </span>from studying <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>in a library which is a bad idea.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>because they might be tempted to go down and socialize with friends instead of focusing on their work.</span></p>

<p><strong>Kevin</strong></p>
<p>The woman <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>seen </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>thinks </span>the university's plan is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>on the necessary. And </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>unnecessary. She has two main reasons for this. First, </span>she <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>seen the university's roundabout two things. And the third thing is she would not like </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>doesn't want </span>to go to the cafeteria because they only offer <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>some </span>unhealthy food like sandwiches and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>so on. So she won't go to </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>snacks. She believes that if </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>cafeteria. And </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>cafe is in </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>second thing </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>basement, students will just grab junk food instead of healthy options. Second, </span>she thinks <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the university's round is. They don't want to do extra work so </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>that </span>if she knows her <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>friend is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>friends are down </span>in the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>basement and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>basement, </span>she <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>would like </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>will be tempted </span>to go <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>to the basement and </span>hang out with <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>them. So the woman seen </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>them instead of focusing on her studies. So, she believes </span>this plan <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>will not help students concentrate and </span>is really <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>unuseful and unuseable. That's her opinion.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>not useful.</span></p>

<p><strong>Seanna</strong></p>
<p>The university <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>wants </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>plans </span>to open a cafe in the library’s basement, thinking that students will appreciate the convenience of eating without leaving the library. In addition, students can take short breaks there. However, the woman in the conversation strongly disagrees with this idea. She argues that even though students won’t have to go to the cafeteria when the weather is bad, it still isn’t a good idea. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>Students may end up eating </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>She believes that students will eat </span>unhealthy food, such as sandwiches <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>or soda. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>and soda, instead of healthier options available in the cafeteria. </span>Her second point is that the new cafe will distract students. If students see their friends hanging out there, they will be tempted to join them, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>and this will make </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>making </span>it hard for them to focus on their studies.</p>

However, </span>I think <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>it's </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>it’s </span>not a good <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>suggestion with </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>idea for </span>two reasons. First, having <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>that, and shifting that. And it will </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>a café in the library might </span>distract <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the student.

Second, the café will likely serve mostly junk food, which isn’t healthy for students. It would be better to have healthier options like </span>in the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>cafeteria, so they will tell with it in the cafeteria second is about. And it will just only prepare some junk food and accentuate or so that they will not be healthy for the students.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>cafeteria.</span></p>

<p><strong>Tina</strong></p>
<p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>Hello University of Anche I retired her coffee shop since London because she think it's time for its children who want that kid and with her football injury on her study and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Hello, the university's plan to build a cafe </span>in the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>next year's he ghoboyangi show </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>library </span>is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>wearing antennae decision for </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>not a good idea. The woman believes this because </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>first day things </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>cafe will only serve unhealthy snacks and junk food, which can harm students' health. She thinks that having a cafe </span>in <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>Germany </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the library will distract students from studying, especially if their friends </span>are <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>more tuned here and also the food </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>hanging out there. Overall, she feels </span>that the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>coffee shop provides. It just the junk food, it is fed from our students' health. So it's </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>cafe will not help students focus </span>on <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>things you can do. And also to be able to get some food. So I'm very in the coffee shop. You may be everyone in church yourself.

<p>The <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>woman expresses her </span>opinion <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>an university decided </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the university's decision </span>to build a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>cafe </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>café </span>in the basement of the library <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>for </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>is not a good idea. She believes that even though </span>students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>that they don't need </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>won't have </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>live </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>leave </span>the library <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>whenever they want </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>live </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>eat, it will create problems. First, she argues that the café will mostly serve unhealthy snacks </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>they can still take shopperks in </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>junk food, while </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>cafe. And the women disagree with this opinion. Here, two women's, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>cafeteria offers healthier options. Second, </span>she <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>get the first to really miss. The cafeteria will only serve some healthy snacks instead of healthy food and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>thinks that if </span>students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>will only get junk food in the cafeteria. And the second reason is if somebody's </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>know their </span>friends are <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>chatting </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>hanging out </span>in the basement, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>so definitely the students </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>they </span>will <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>go </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>be tempted </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the basement </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>leave their study areas </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>have a lunch </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>join them </span>instead of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>sitting in the cafe in the library.

<p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>In </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The university plans to build a cafe in </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>reading, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>library, but </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>university wants </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>woman has a negative opinion about it. She believes that even though students won't have </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>have </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>leave the library to eat, it will actually encourage them to eat unhealthy food. The cafe will mainly serve snacks and sandwiches, which she considers junk food, unlike the healthier options available in the cafeteria. She also thinks that having </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>coffee shop. I have two reasons. The first is if you are coming in, that means students need to go out of the university. They can eat things in their library. It can well not disrupt the study of students. The second reason is that they can relax </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>cafe </span>in the library <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>so that it is a good way </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>will distract students from studying because they'll be tempted </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>improve the efficiency. But in the last news, we know that the girl thinks it's very bad. The first reason she thinks that is in the library is coffee shop. There are always some snacks and sandwiches. It's junk food. It's not good for healthy. You prefer to go to the restaurant you see. And see if you can read it. This place is where we are now.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>hang out with friends instead of focusing on their work.</span></p>

<p>So, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>I'm going to say that </span>the first thing I <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>decided </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>want </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>do was take </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>mention is that </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>measurement of library and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>woman expresses her concern about the university's plan to build a cafe </span>in <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>this way, then don't need </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the library. She believes that while it might be convenient not </span>to leave the library <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>whatever they want to get. And we'll have an opportunity to take a short break. However, I mean, these are ways with this idea. First, she thinks that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>for food, </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>table may interest offers some healthiest next </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>cafe will mainly offer unhealthy options </span>like soda <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>or sandwich. And actually, it's not </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>and sandwiches, which aren't </span>good for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>health problems. And what is more, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>students' health. Additionally, </span>she <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>thinks </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>worries </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>other </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>if </span>students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>will </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>know their friends are chatting in the cafe, they might </span>be <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>calcantrate because they need </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>tempted </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>work around </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>join them instead of focusing on their studies.

And the thing is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>offers healthier options. Additionally, she mentions </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>most of students, they will not eat </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>having friends nearby </span>in the library <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>because in </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>might distract students, making it harder for them to focus on their studies.

The </span>cafeteria <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>offers healthier food options, which she thinks is important. Second, she worries that having a cafe in the library will distract students. If they know their friends are hanging out in the basement, they might be tempted to go down </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the students want to eat snacks.

The second, the student motor </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>chat instead </span>of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the student have the extra work.

<p>The <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>students suggest </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>female student expresses her opinion against </span>the university's <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>library </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>plan </span>to build a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>cafeteria underground, because </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>cafe in </span>the <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>library. She believes that while it might be convenient for </span>students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>are really affected because they have bad effect because they need </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>not </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>go </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>leave the library, it could lead to unhealthy eating habits. She points out that many students will choose </span>to eat <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>something. And </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>junk food available in </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>university seems </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>cafe instead of walking to the cafeteria, which offers healthier options. Additionally, she worries </span>that if <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the student has a break, it can improve </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>students know </span>their <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>effect. However, the students </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>friends </span>are <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>disagreeable with such opinions. The students say that the students won't work out of the library, even also in the workout to the library also because the weather is bad, because the student eats junk food in the library, so they won't go to the cafeteria to eat some healthy food. Also, if the student has a friend that just hand </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>hanging </span>out in the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>library, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>cafe, </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>will come and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>might be tempted to go there instead of focusing on their studies. This could make it harder for them to </span>concentrate <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>in </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>on </span>their <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>walk.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>work.</span></p>

<p>The suggestion is to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>suggest that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>build a cafe </span>in the school library <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>they need to have a small shop </span>that offers <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>students snacks. But in </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>snacks to students. However, </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>conversation, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>female student thinks this is a bad idea for a couple of reasons. First, she believes </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>women students think that it's not good because it's a few healthy snacks. Nobody wants to get there and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>cafe will only serve unhealthy snacks, while </span>the cafeteria <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>serves healthy </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>provides healthier options. She thinks that students will be more likely to grab junk </span>food <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>instead of making </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>students can </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>effort to </span>walk to the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>second reason is, once the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>cafeteria. Second, she mentions that if </span>students in the library know <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>that </span>their friends are <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>chatting with </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>hanging out in </span>the basement, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>it can let </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>they might be tempted to join </span>them <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>instead of studying. This could hurt their concentration and productivity. Overall, she feels that this proposal could have negative effects on students' ability </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>be more wisdomful to get down to the basement and chatting with </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>focus on </span>their <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>friends. So it's not a positive effect for students concentration in the study. So this one is doing things. It's not a good proposal.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>studies.</span></p>

<p>The university <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is planned </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>plans </span>to open a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>coffee </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>cafe </span>in the basement of the library because they believe <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>soon </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>students </span>will enjoy the convenience of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the </span>eating without leaving the library. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>¶ And the student </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Students </span>can take <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>a </span>short <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>break here. ¶ </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>breaks there while studying. </span>However, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>though </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>girl disagree </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>female student disagrees </span>with <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>this. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>this plan. </span>First, she thinks <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>and </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>also </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>when the weather is bad, </span>students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>don't need </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>won't want </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>go </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>walk </span>to the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>coffee to eat cafeteria to eat exactly when the water is bad and everything is chunk. ¶ They must they might </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>cafeteria; instead, they'll </span>just grab <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>some chunk food, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>unhealthy snacks </span>like <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>sandwich </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>sandwiches, sodas, </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>soda and coffee, which is rare unhealthy. ¶ </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>sweets from the cafe. She believes this will lead to students eating junk food instead of healthier options available in the cafeteria. </span>Her second reason is that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the new coffee is gonna be distinguished. ¶ She still distracting the two students. ¶ If </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>if </span>students know <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>her friend and know </span>their <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>chatting, they </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>friends </span>are <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>like to complete </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>chatting in the basement, they'll be tempted </span>to join <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>them. ¶ Yes. ¶ And so, yes yes.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>them, which could distract them from their studies.

First, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The idea is </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>satisfy the student's requirements. Some students, compels that they </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>meet students' needs since many </span>have to leave the library <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>when they have lunch or dinner then it will always time. The second is to provide better places, provides students with better places. And however, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>for meals, which takes time away from studying. However, </span>the woman in the conversation <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is then agreed </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>disagrees </span>with this <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>work. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>plan for a couple of reasons. </span>First, she <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>thinks </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>believes the </span>coffee <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>shops </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>shop </span>will <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>sell only housey </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>mainly serve unhealthy </span>snacks like <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>some </span>fast <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>food and so </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>food, which could be bad for students’ health. Second, she worries that having friends nearby in the basement will distract her from studying, as she might be tempted to hang out with them instead of focusing </span>on <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>that we'll be harmful to </span>her <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>house. In the second, it will be disturbed by her friends. Just if there is a shop on the basement, they will hide out there.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>work.</span></p>

<p>The <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lecture says that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>woman expresses her opinion about </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>university is going </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>university’s plan </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>work </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>build a cafe </span>in the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>library because </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>library, and she is not in favor of it. She believes that while it’s convenient not to leave </span>the <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>library, it could lead to problems. First, she thinks that </span>students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>who enjoy the students' work are very small. Because the students can take a short break here </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>will be tempted to eat unhealthy snacks </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>they will not go to </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>junk food instead of healthier options available in </span>the cafeteria. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>Because the lesson is amazing because the students don't need to go to the cafeteria to eat. And the second reason is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>This could negatively affect their health and focus. Second, she worries </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the new cafeteria is where they take the students. The </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>if </span>students know <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>their friends are hanging out in </span>the <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>cafe, they might be distracted and tempted to join them instead of studying.

First, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>she's in Snowman where I'll take her break by working in </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>she believes that </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>cafeteria. The cafeteria </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>cafe </span>will serve unhealthy foods, like <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>some snakes </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>snacks </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>drinks. Most </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>sugary drinks, which means </span>students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>will choose healthier food options. So they </span>might miss out <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>these </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>on healthier food options available in the </span>cafeteria. Second, <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>she worries that </span>if students know their friends <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>or children's cafeteria, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>are in the cafe, </span>they might be tempted to leave their work <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>and have a lesson.

<p>The <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>plan is the </span>university <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is prepared </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>plans </span>to build a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>cave </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>café </span>in the library <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>and </span>so that students <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>can eat without having to leave. The woman disagrees with this plan for a couple of reasons. First, she is concerned about the food options. She believes that the café will only serve unhealthy snacks and fast food, which is not good for students' health. Second, she thinks that having a café </span>in the library <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>can eat at </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>will make it harder for students to concentrate. If they know their friends are hanging out in </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>library </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>café, they might be tempted to go down </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>without going out. And also they can do </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>socialize instead of focusing on </span>their <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>work at take a break when they are working. The woman is a bridge with the university's plan. Firstly she is seeing the food, the cave's serve is not healthy and they will only provide the snakes and other fast food. So it's bad for the students' health. And another reason she thinks it will... The student can concentrate if it has a cave. She will think she will hand out with his friends and not concentrate.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>work.</span></p>

The woman disagrees </span>with <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>us. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>this plan for a couple of reasons. </span>First, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>he mentioned </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>she mentions </span>that the food <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>available </span>in the library <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is always valid. It just offers some </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>will be mostly unhealthy snacks, like </span>junk food and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>some </span>simple <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>sandwich. And the teacher and the student will eat junk food. So it's </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>sandwiches. She believes it would be </span>better <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>for students </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>let the student do </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>go to </span>the cafeteria <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>and have </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>where there are healthier meal options. Secondly, she thinks that having </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>meal. And the second is about when there's a basement cafeteria </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>cafe </span>in the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>library. Sometimes the student </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>library </span>will <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>attract by the noise or </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>be distracting. If students know </span>their friends are <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>chatting on </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>hanging out in </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>library. So </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>basement, </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>will also turn </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>might be tempted </span>to join <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the chat. Instead </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>them instead </span>of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>giving some words or focus </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>focusing </span>on <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>your study, so </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>their studies. This could make </span>it <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is another group.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>harder for students to concentrate on their work.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>So, mental is so good with </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The woman has a negative opinion about the </span>university's <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>plans that she can sing the capi </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>plan to build a cafe </span>in the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>library, so necessary </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>library. She believes that while it might be convenient </span>for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>all </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>students, it will actually lead to unhealthy eating habits. She points out that </span>the <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>cafe will mostly serve junk food like snacks, sweets, and soda, which is not as healthy as the options available in the cafeteria. Additionally, she worries that if students know their friends are in the cafe, they might be tempted to leave their study areas and socialize instead of focusing on their work. Overall, she thinks having a cafe in the library could distract </span>students and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the shaker must have a reason </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lead </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>explain it. And first of all, she sings also food in the laboratory are </span>unhealthy <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>because they are all near all the snack or some sweet soda, so it's unhealthy for all the students. If you go out and you go to the cafeteria and you can use a lot of the food and they says healthy for all the students, so choosing that it's in the cafeteria is better than it in the laboratory. And the second reason is choosing that if we know there are some friends in there and they want to help with them and it's not too long on things, so they don't sing. It's all you know, she don't sing the lampering, the capi is necessary for all the students and she want to have this.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>choices.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>He said, she talked </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The woman expresses her opinion </span>about <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the university's plan </span>to build a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>store or </span>cafe <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>shop in library because students want to eat in library. It would be very easy to start study. And this woman, this woman, she think the library is a coffee shop or snake </span>in the library. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>It is a junk food, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>She believes that while </span>it <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is not </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>may seem convenient for students to eat there, it actually creates problems. She thinks that the cafe will mostly serve unhealthy snacks, which isn't </span>good for <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>their </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>students' </span>health. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>And you stay high out </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Instead of going </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>restaurant, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the cafeteria, especially in bad weather, students might just grab junk food from the cafe. Moreover, she worries that if her friends are down in the basement chatting, she might be tempted </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>go </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>join them, making it hard </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>make friends </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>concentrate on studying. Overall, she disagrees with the plan because she thinks it will distract students </span>and <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lead </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>go with my friends, to go with your friends, to go make their friends relationship with someone. So she is a group with this plan.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>unhealthy eating habits.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>According to </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The article discusses </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>later, the university decided </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>university's plan </span>to build a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>cafeteria </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>cafe </span>in the library for two <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>main </span>reasons. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>Firstly, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>First, </span>it <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>can offer some </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>aims to provide </span>convenience for students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>to </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>so they can </span>eat without leaving the library. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>Secondly, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Second, </span>it <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>can </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>is believed that having a cafe will </span>help students <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>be more productive by allowing them </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>be efficient when they </span>take <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>some little risk. And according to </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>short breaks. However, </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>conversation, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>female student in </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>girls </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>conversation </span>strongly <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>disagree </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>disagrees </span>with <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the idea </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>this plan </span>for two reasons. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>Firstly, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>First, </span>she <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>mentions </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>points out </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>although </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>while </span>students can <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>go to the underground cafeteria to eat when the weather is bad, but the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>quickly grab </span>food in <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>it is very </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the basement, the options will be </span>unhealthy <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>snacks </span>and <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>junk food, which </span>many students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>do not like </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>dislike. Second, she argues that if students see their friends hanging out in </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>food in it. Secondly, she mentions that especially for the students whose friends are chatting and adding the cafeteria, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>cafe, </span>it will <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>distract them from studying and make it harder to concentrate on their work. Overall, she feels that the cafe could actually </span>disrupt <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the students from their study.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>students' studies rather than help them.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>In a really mature </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The </span>university plans to build a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>cave </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>cafe </span>in the basement of the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>library </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>library, </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>thanks it can </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>while they think this will </span>help students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>to </span>work more <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>effectively. However, in lecture, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>effectively, many students disagree. They believe that </span>the <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>cafe will only serve unhealthy snacks and junk food like sandwiches and sweets. Additionally, </span>students <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>entirely against this plan, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>worry that if </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>think the cave </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>know their friends are </span>in the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>library only serves junk foods like sandwich </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>cafe, they will be tempted to go down </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>healthy snacks. But also, the students can't concentrate </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>chat instead of studying. This could really distract them and make it hard to focus </span>on their <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>study because they were chatting with their friends and they may just to help with their friends. So the students can't concentrate on their study effectively.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>work.</span></p>
