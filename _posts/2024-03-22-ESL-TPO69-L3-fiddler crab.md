# TPO69 Lecture 3: Fiddler Crab's Vision and Behavior <br> TPO69 讲座3：招潮蟹的视觉与行为

## Main Points <br> 主要观点

### Introduction to Animal Visual Perception <br> 动物视觉感知的介绍
- The way an animal sees the world affects its behavior. <br> 动物的视觉方式影响其行为。
- Understanding animal behavior requires considering perceptual differences. <br> 理解动物行为需要考虑感知上的差异。
- Current theories might be biased due to not accounting for these differences. <br> 由于没有考虑这些差异，当前的理论可能存在偏见。

### Differences in Vision: Example of Insects <br> 视觉差异：昆虫的例子
- Insects with compound eyes see multiple images of an object, unlike humans who see only one. <br> 有复眼的昆虫看到一个物体的多个图像，而人类只看到一个。

### Fiddler Crab's Vision <br> 招潮蟹的视觉
- Fiddler crabs have compound eyes on stalks, offering 360-degree vision. <br> 招潮蟹的复眼位于柄上，提供360度的视野。
- Their vision is sharpest at the periphery, aiding in distinguishing between rivals and mates. <br> 它们的视觉在边缘处最为敏锐，有助于区分对手和伴侣。
- The center of their vision, aimed at the sky, is blurrier, making it difficult to identify specific threats. <br> 它们视野的中心，对准天空的部分，更模糊，难以识别特定威胁。

### Behavioral Adaptations <br> 行为适应
- The fiddler crab assumes everything in the sky is a predator and everything on the ground is a crab. <br> 招潮蟹假设天空中的一切都是捕食者，地面上的一切都是招潮蟹。
- Blurry vision, which seems disadvantageous, simplifies survival responses. <br> 看似不利的模糊视觉简化了生存反应。

### Research Findings <br> 研究发现
- Experiments with cylinders demonstrated that fiddler crabs perceive objects based on their placement. <br> 通过圆柱体的实验表明，招潮蟹根据物体的放置位置来感知物体。
  - Objects on the ground are treated as other crabs. <br> 地面上的物体被视为其他招潮蟹。
  - Objects in the air are considered predators, prompting crabs to seek safety. <br> 空中的物体被认为是捕食者，促使招潮蟹寻求安全。

## Conclusion <br> 结论
- Fiddler crab's unique vision significantly influences its behavior, emphasizing the importance of considering perceptual differences in understanding animal behavior. <br> 招潮蟹独特的视觉显著影响其行为，强调了在理解动物行为时考虑感知差异的重要性。
