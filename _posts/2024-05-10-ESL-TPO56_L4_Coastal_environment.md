# Coastal Environment (TPO56_L4) <br> TPO56_L4 海岸环境

## Introduction: Personal Story <br> 介绍：个人故事
- The professor considered buying a house near the ocean for the family. <br> 教授考虑为家人购买一栋靠近海洋的房子。
- Environmentally, building near the ocean is impractical. <br> 从环境角度看，在海洋附近建房是不切实际的。
- They couldn't afford the house, which turned out to be fortunate due to environmental factors. <br> 他们负担不起这栋房子，事实证明，这反而是幸运的。

## Coastal Zones Overview <br> 海岸区域概述
- Different coastal zones from the ocean edge: beach, primary dune, trough, secondary dune, back dune. <br> 从海洋边缘开始的不同海岸区域：沙滩、初级沙丘、槽、次级沙丘、背沙丘。

## Zone Characteristics and Suitability <br> 区域特点和适用性

### Beach <br> 沙滩
- Not suitable for building due to shifting sands and tidal fluctuations. <br> 由于沙子移动和潮汐波动，不适合建房。
- Example: Sandy Peninsula's changing shoreline. <br> 例子：Sandy Peninsula的海岸线变化。

### Primary Dune <br> 初级沙丘
- Fragile, supports initial vegetation, easily disturbed. <br> 脆弱，支持初步植被，容易受到干扰。
- Disturbance leads to inland migration of sand, causing beach erosion. <br> 干扰导致沙子向内陆移动，导致海滩侵蚀。

### Trough <br> 槽
- Suitable for limited recreation and some building. <br> 适合有限的娱乐活动和一些建筑。
- Thicker vegetation and more stable ground. <br> 植被较厚，地面较稳定。

### Secondary Dune <br> 次级沙丘
- Acts as the final defense against the sea. <br> 作为对抗大海的最后一道防线。
- No building should occur here. <br> 不应在此建房。

### Back Dune <br> 背沙丘
- Most suitable for development compared to other zones. <br> 与其他区域相比，最适合开发。

## Environmental Importance <br> 环境重要性
- Coastal zones protect inland areas from saltwater flooding and storm damage. <br> 海岸区保护内陆地区免受盐水淹没和风暴破坏。
- They provide a buffer zone for vegetation growth against wind and salt spray. <br> 它们为植被生长提供了防风和盐雾的缓冲区。

## Building Challenges and Consequences <br> 建筑挑战和后果
- People desire to build on the beach and primary dune despite the risks. <br> 尽管有风险，人们仍希望在沙滩和初级沙丘上建房。
- Example: Dream house destabilized by a storm, causing beach erosion and making it uninhabitable. <br> 例子：梦想中的房子因风暴而不稳定，导致海滩侵蚀，使其无法居住。

## Conclusion <br> 结论
- Building in coastal zones, especially the beach and primary dune, poses significant environmental and stability challenges. <br> 在海岸区，特别是沙滩和初级沙丘建房，存在重大环境和稳定性挑战。
- Understanding coastal zone characteristics can guide better building practices and environmental preservation. <br> 理解海岸区特性可以指导更好的建筑实践和环境保护。
