# TPO59_L3_Mass Wasting<br>TPO59_L2_块体运动

## Introduction to Mass Wasting<br>块体运动介绍
- Mass wasting refers to geological movements of land, including various forms such as landslides and rock falls.<br>块体运动指的是土地的地质移动，包括各种形式，如滑坡和岩石坠落。
- Phenomena like landslides can be dramatic, moving at speeds up to 300 kilometers per hour.<br>像滑坡这样的现象可能非常戏剧性，其移动速度可达每小时300公里。

## Creep: A Common Type of Mass Wasting<br>蠕变：一种常见的块体运动
- Creep is a prevalent form of mass wasting, especially on gentle hills or slopes.<br>蠕变是一种普遍的块体运动形式，尤其是在缓和的山丘或斜坡上。
- It is a slow process, with soil moving only a few centimeters to a meter downhill annually.<br>这是一个缓慢的过程，土壤每年只向下移动几厘米到一米。
- Causes:<br>原因：
  - Primarily driven by gravity.<br>主要由重力驱动。
  - Water plays a significant role in movement.<br>水在运动中起着重要作用。
- Mechanism:<br>机制：
  - Occurs through freeze-thaw cycles.<br>通过冻融循环发生。
  - Soil expands when frozen and contracts upon thawing, moving slightly downhill due to gravity.<br>土壤在冻结时膨胀，在解冻时收缩，由于重力作用略微向下移动。
- Evidence:<br>证据：
  - Manifested in curved trees or tilted fences over years.<br>多年来表现在弯曲的树木或倾斜的栅栏上。

## Solifluction: Mass Wasting in Permafrost Areas<br>溶蚀流：永久冻土区的块体运动
- Similar to creep but occurs in regions with permafrost.<br>与蠕变相似，但发生在有永久冻土的地区。
- Soil moves uniformly down the slope as one large mass.<br>土壤作为一个大块均匀地沿斜坡向下移动。
- Mechanism:<br>机制：
  - Top layer of soil thaws in summer, becomes saturated with water, and moves over the still-frozen ground beneath.<br>夏季顶层土壤解冻，变得饱和水分，并在下面仍然冻结的地面上移动。
- Example:<br>示例：
  - Stumps from the 1940s in Spitsbergen, Norway, show visible effects of solifluction.<br>挪威斯匹茨卑尔根岛1940年代的树桩显示了溶蚀流的可见效应。

## Factors Influencing Mass Wasting<br>影响块体运动的因素
- Primarily a function of slope, gravity, and water.<br>主要是斜坡、重力和水的功能。
- In Spitsbergen, the rate of solifluction varies due to snow being blown off slopes, reducing the amount of thawed soil.<br>在斯匹茨卑尔根岛，由于雪被吹离斜坡，减少了融化土壤的数量，溶蚀流的速率有所不同。

## Building Considerations on Slopes and Permafrost<br>在斜坡和永久冻土上建造的考虑
- Building on hills can be risky but is feasible with slope stabilization techniques.<br>在山丘上建造可能有风险，但通过斜坡稳定技术是可行的。
- Building directly on permafrost, especially slopes, is discouraged.<br>不鼓励直接在永久冻土上，尤其是斜坡上建造。
- Recommendations for construction on permafrost:<br>在永久冻土上建造的建议：
  - Use posts to elevate buildings to prevent overheating the surface.<br>使用柱子抬高建筑物以防止表面过热。
  - Allows freezing air to flow under the structure, keeping permafrost intact.<br>允许冷冻空气流过结构下方，保持永久冻土完整。
  - Heating permafrost can accelerate mass wasting processes, leading to slides or flows.<br>加热永久冻土可以加速块体运动过程，导致滑动或流动。
