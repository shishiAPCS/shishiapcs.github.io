|-----------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------|
| geological term | A term used in the study of the Earth's physical structure and substance. | 地质学术语 | "Mass wasting is our geological term for movements of land." |
| well acquainted with | Familiar or knowledgeable about something. | 熟悉 | "You're probably well acquainted with mass wasting associated with steep hills." |
| associated | Connected with something else. | 与...有关 | "Creep is another type of mass wasting, associated with gentle hills or slopes." |
| steep hills | Hills with a sharp incline. | 陡峭的山丘 | "Mass wasting is often associated with steep hills and mountains." |
| by a long shot | By far; clearly. | <span style="color: red;">表示强调</span> | "Creep is, by a long shot, the more common process of mass wasting." |
| slopes | Surfaces of land that incline. | 斜坡 | "There are a lot more gentle slopes where creep happens." |
| ultimately | In the end; finally. | 最终 | "Gravity is ultimately responsible for mass wasting." |
| affects | Has an effect on; makes a difference to. | 影响 | "Water affects the movement in mass wasting processes." |
| downhill | Towards the bottom of a slope. | 下坡 | "The soil moves slowly, only a few centimeters to a meter downhill in a year." |
| bedrock | The solid rock underlying loose deposits such as soil. | 基岩 | "When the top layer of soil freezes, it expands away from the bedrock layer beneath it." |
| thaw | To melt or cause to melt. | 解冻 | "Then, when the ground thaws in the spring, everything contracts." |
| contract | To become smaller or shorter. | 收缩 | "The soil contracts after it thaws, but doesn't return to its original position." |
| Thanks to | Because of; due to. | 多亏了 | "Thanks to gravity, this movement is almost imperceptible." |
| imperceptible | Not noticeable or visible. | 难以察觉的 | "This movement is almost imperceptible and not exciting." |
| forces | Physical power or strength. | 力量 | "You'll never see creep on a TV show about the dangerous forces of nature." |
| curve | To form or cause to form a curve. | 弯曲 | "Over the years, you may see curve trees as evidence of creep." |
| tilted fences | Fences that have become inclined or slanted. | 倾斜的栅栏 | "Tilted fences are another sign of the slow process of creep." |
| colder regions | Areas with low temperatures. | 寒冷地区 | "Creep can happen in colder regions, especially regions with permafrost." |
| uniformly | In a way that is the same in all cases and at all times. | 均匀地 | "In solifluction, the soil moves uniformly down the slope." |
| mass | A large body or quantity of something. | 团；块；堆 | "The soil moves as one large mass, not as individual particles." |
| individual particles | Separate or distinct small units. | 单独的颗粒 | "Not as individual particles, but as a unified mass." |
| melt | To change from a solid to a liquid state usually by heat. | 融化 | "In summer, the top layer of soil above the permafrost will melt." |
| saturated | Completely wet. | 饱和的 | "The active layer is saturated with water and heavier, allowing gravity to do its thing." |
| allowing gravity to do its thing | Letting gravity cause movement or action. | 让重力起作用 | "The saturated soil allows gravity to do its thing, causing solifluction." |
| slide | To move smoothly along a surface. | 滑行 | "Below the active layer, the ground is still frozen, providing a perfect slide." |
| the Arctic | The area around the North Pole, characterized by extreme cold. | 北极 | "In the Arctic, like in Spitsbergen, Norway, solifluction is a common process." |
| era | A long and distinct period of history. | 时代 | "These are stumps left over from a 1940s era structure." |
| stumps | The bottom parts of trees left projecting from the ground after the rest has been cut down. | 树桩 | "The stumps have been pushed over this far due to solifluction." |
| varying rates | Different speeds or frequencies. | 不同的速率 | "In the Spitsbergen area, there are varying rates of solifluction." |
| primarily | Mainly; for the most part. | 主要地 | "Mass wasting is primarily a function of slope and gravity." |
| aided by | Helped by. | 由...帮助 | "The process is aided by water." |
| precipitation | Rain, snow, sleet, or hail that falls to the ground. | 降水 | "Strong winds blow snow off the slopes, affecting the rate of precipitation." |
| rate | The speed with which something happens or is done. | 速度 | "This affects the rate of solifluction." |
| partly | To some degree; in some way or other. | 部分地 | "Building on hills is done partly because slopes can be stabilized." |
| stabilized | Made or become unlikely to give way or overturn. | 稳定的 | "Slopes can be stabilized in various ways." |
| is a different story | Is a separate issue or situation. | 另当别论 | "Building on permafrost is a different story." |
| elevate | To raise or lift up. | 抬高 | "You want to use posts to elevate the building." |
| intact | Not damaged or impaired in any way; complete. | 完好无损 | "This keeps the permafrost intact." |
| destabilize | To make something unstable. | 使不稳定 | "Heating it up risks destabilizing the ground." |
