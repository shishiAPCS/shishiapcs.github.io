<td>Well, I agree with the statement that students will be more likely to achieve great success on their academic performance when they have well-organized habits. Because if they control themselves well, they will totally focus on the thing that they need to do on this period, and this makes them much more easier to succeed. For example, I have a friend, she used to waste a lot of time on her study because she can&#39;t organize herself well, but after she used the schedule to control her time, her grades have visibly improved.</td>

<td>I do agree that students with well-organized habits are more likely to achieve great success on their academic performance because their language and grammar will be no mistakes and the language they speak is very logical and it&#39;s easy to understand what they have said.

<td>Sword</td>
<td>Honestly speaking, I disagree with the statement that students will be more likely to achieve greater success on their academic performance when they have well-organized habits. There are basically two reasons for that. Firstly, sometimes students need intuitions and they need casual thinking. For example, every afternoon I like to think casually on a not fixed thing and I always get something important or surprising. Secondly, it&#39;s not fair to rule all the students just because of a better organized habit. Every student is different and some students may don&#39;t like to be ruled or to be organized by their habits.</td>
<td>&quot;Honestly, I have to disagree with the idea that students will achieve greater academic success solely through well-organized habits. I have two main reasons for this. Firstly, students sometimes need to rely on intuition and engage in casual thinking. Personally, I find that taking time in the afternoon to casually ponder various topics often leads to important and surprising insights. Secondly, it wouldn&#39;t be fair to expect all students to conform to strict organizational habits. Every student is unique, and some may not thrive under such rigid structures.&quot;</td>
