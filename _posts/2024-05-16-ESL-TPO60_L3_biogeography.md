# [Biogeography (TPO60_L3) <br> TPO60_L3 生物地理学](https://smarter.igo1996.com/tf-listen-analysis?id=3871&type=3&tagId=185&status=0)

## Main Topic: Island Biogeography <br> 主题：岛屿生物地理学
- Biogeography is the geographic distribution of plants and animals in an environment. <br> 生物地理学是指植物和动物在环境中的地理分布。
- Island environments are unique due to their isolation, serving as natural laboratories for studying ecosystems. <br> 由于其隔离性，岛屿环境是研究生态系统的天然实验室。

## Equilibrium Theory of Island Biogeography <br> 岛屿生物地理学的平衡理论
- Developed by Robert MacArthur and E.O. Wilson in the 1960s. <br> 由罗伯特·麦克阿瑟和E.O.威尔逊在1960年代提出。
- States that islands achieve a balance in the number of species they support over time. <br> 该理论指出，随着时间的推移，岛屿在其支持的物种数量上会达到平衡。
- The total number of species depends on the size and location of the island. <br> 物种的总数取决于岛屿的大小和位置。

## Factors Influencing Species Equilibrium <br> 影响物种平衡的因素
- **Size of the Island**: Larger islands can support more species. <br> **岛屿大小**：较大的岛屿可以支持更多的物种。
- **Proximity to Mainland**: Islands closer to the mainland have higher species immigration rates. <br> **与大陆的接近程度**：靠近大陆的岛屿有较高的物种移民率。

## Opposing Forces in Island Environments <br> 岛屿环境中的对立力量
1. **Immigration Rate** <br> **移民率**
   - Addition of new species to the island. <br> 向岛屿添加新物种。
   - Higher initially but declines over time as competition increases. <br> 最初较高，但随着竞争加剧，随着时间推移而下降。
2. **Extinction Rate** <br> **灭绝率**
   - Disappearance of species from the island. <br> 物种从岛屿消失。
   - Increases over time due to space competition and vulnerability to changes. <br> 由于空间竞争和对变化的脆弱性，随着时间的推移而增加。

## Achieving Equilibrium <br> 达到平衡
- Equilibrium is achieved when immigration matches extinction. <br> 当移民率与灭绝率相匹配时，达到平衡。
- Larger and closer islands reach equilibrium with more species. <br> 较大和较近的岛屿在更多物种下达到平衡。

## Case Study: Krakatoa <br> 案例研究：喀拉喀托岛
- Krakatoa, an island in Indonesia, had its ecosystem destroyed by a volcanic eruption in 1883. <br> 印度尼西亚的喀拉喀托岛的生态系统在1883年被火山爆发摧毁。
- Initial colonizers were weeds, beetles, and spiders. <br> 初期殖民者是杂草、甲虫和蜘蛛。
- Over time, a grassland ecosystem developed, followed by forests. <br> 随着时间的推移，形成了草原生态系统，随后是森林。
- The island's species count aligns with the equilibrium theory's predictions. <br> 岛屿的物种数量与平衡理论的预测一致。

## Conclusion <br> 结论
- While Krakatoa's development supports the equilibrium theory, other factors may also influence island biogeography. <br> 虽然喀拉喀托的发展支持平衡理论，但其他因素也可能影响岛屿生物地理学。
