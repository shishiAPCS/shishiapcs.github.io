### Enclothed Cognition
Researchers have known for some time that wearing a particular kind of clothing can affect how people perceive themselves. Recently,however, researchers have discovered that clothing may affect more than just how we feel about ourselves.The clothes people wear may also change their ability to process information and perform tasks, a phenomenon known as enclothed cognition. Certain clothing can have a particular meaning or association and wearing this clothing may cause people to think and act in a way that reflects this association.

## Listening

Now, listen to part of a lecture in a psychology class. Ok. So scientists did an experiment that demonstrated how this works. The study used long white lab coats, just like medical doctors wear here in the US now, what traits do we associate with doctors? For one thing, we know they're observant. They need to pay attention to detail. So researchers wanted to see if people who weren't medical doctors would show this behavior while wearing lab coats. Here's what they did. They got two groups of volunteers. And in one of the groups, each of the volunteers was given a lab coat to wear. And in the other group, each volunteer was just shown a lab coat. It was put on the table in front of them, and they were told to look at it. And in each case, of course, the volunteers were told that these were doctors' lab coats. So to test their abilities, the volunteers had to look at two pictures that were almost the same, but not quite. Then the participants had to see how many differences they could notice between the two pictures. And here's the interesting thing. The people who were wearing doctors' lab coats noticed more differences than the people who just looked at the lab coats. So the researchers concluded that by actually wearing the lab coats, people started to act like doctors to be more observant and better at noticing small details.

<p>The <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>purpose is when people </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>example from the professor’s lecture illustrates enclothed cognition by showing how clothing can influence behavior. In the study, there </span>were <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>in </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>two groups of volunteers. One group wore white lab coats, while </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>different clothes, they made influences, opinions about some things, and such as, this example, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>other group only looked at the lab coats without wearing them.

When </span>they were <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>tested on their ability to notice differences </span>in <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>pictures, </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>white clothes, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>group wearing the lab coats noticed more details than the group that only looked at them.

<p>The concept <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>includes the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>of enclothed </span>cognition refers to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>a type of association that takes place when people </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>how </span>wearing specific <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>kinds </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>types </span>of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>clothes. So to observe this behavior, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>clothing can influence our thoughts and behaviors. In the lecture, the professor described an experiment where </span>researchers <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>set up a research observation that contains </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>divided volunteers into </span>two <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>groups of people. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>groups. </span>One <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>of them is required to wear up a </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>group wore </span>white lab <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>coat that is usually wear </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>coats, like those worn </span>by <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>doctors and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>doctors, while </span>the other group <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is just showing the white </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>only looked at a </span>lab <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>clothes. So they both are observing </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>coat placed in front of them. Both groups then observed </span>two pictures that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>have </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>had </span>tiny <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>differences to be recognized. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>differences. </span>The <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>thing is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>interesting finding was </span>that the group <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>of people who are </span>wearing the lab <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>clothes are standing out </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>coats noticed more differences than the group that just looked at them. This shows that wearing the lab coat made the volunteers act more observantly, like doctors, demonstrating the idea </span>of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>recognized differences.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>enclothed cognition.</span></p>

<p>The professor <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>demonstrate the example, there are </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>explained an experiment that illustrates enclothed cognition. There were </span>two <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>groups. One group is one tier and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>groups of volunteers: </span>one group <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is a medical doctor, one group who </span>wore lab <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>coat </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>coats, which are typically associated with doctors, </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>another </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the other </span>group <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>who wore shoe </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>just looked at lab coats placed on a table. Both groups were tasked with observing two similar pictures and identifying the differences. The results showed that the group wearing the lab coats noticed more differences than the group that only looked at them. This demonstrates that wearing the </span>lab coat <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>made people act more observantly, reflecting the idea that clothing can influence how we think </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the very both observative similar picture and found out the difference the result is the people who wear lab coat can observate more details and more difference so we can we can know that the closing effect the information see how she</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>process information.</span></p>

<p>In the reading, it explains <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the enclosed combination is </span>that <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>enclothed cognition means </span>when people <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>bearing close, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>wear certain clothes, it can affect how </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>will be affected by the disclosed. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>feel and act. </span>The professor gave an <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>example. There were </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>example of an experiment with </span>two groups of people. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>It was </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>One group wore doctors' lab coats, while </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>first </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>other </span>group <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>just looked at the lab coats without </span>wearing <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the doctor's name of close, and the second people just watched the gram of the doctor name close. And after </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>them. After </span>that, they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>all see a graph of </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>were shown two pictures that were almost </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>nub-close. But this nub-close is a little different with the nub-close they were wearing. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>same but had some differences. </span>The first <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>group of people, they can find </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>group, who wore the lab coats, was able to notice </span>more <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>details that are different with </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>differences between the </span>two <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>closes, and they are more easy to see </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>pictures </span>than the second group. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>So with this situation, they found </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>This shows </span>that <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>by wearing </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>people were pretending that they were a doctor </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lab coats, the participants started to think </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>find </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>act like doctors, which helped them pay </span>more <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>attention to </span>details.</p>

In the professor's lecture, the example of the lab coat experiment illustrates this concept well. The study showed that participants who wore lab coats, which are associated with doctors, performed better at noticing details compared to those who only looked at the lab coats. This suggests that wearing certain types of clothing can enhance our cognitive abilities and make us act </span>in <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>a neighborhood where there were many children of my age and I always had a lot of fun together.

<p>In <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>Clothis, cognition is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>enclothed cognition, the way people think and act can be influenced by the clothing they wear.

<p>The researchers <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>said </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>explained </span>that the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>particle close will </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>particular clothes people wear can influence </span>not just <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>influence </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>how they feel about </span>themselves, but also their behaviors. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>And this code includes </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>This relates to the concept of enclothed </span>cognition. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>And </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>In the lecture, </span>the professor <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>in the speaking part just knew to found the association from the particle close to the doctor's behavior. And he just found the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>described an experiment with </span>two groups of volunteers. <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>One group wore lab coats like those worn by doctors, while the other group only looked at the lab coats placed in front of them. </span>The first <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>volunteer needed to wear </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>group, wearing </span>the lab <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>coat from </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>coats, had to find differences between two similar pictures. The results showed that </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>doctor. And the second one just sees </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>people wearing </span>the lab <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>coat behind it. And the first one who needed to found the difference from the two pictures. And they found that the person who wears the lab coat will act </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>coats noticed more differences, acting more observantly </span>like <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the doctor</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>doctors. This illustrates how wearing certain clothes can change how we think and behave.</span></p>

<p>So, <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the concept </span>is called <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>Nanishin is center course in cat health, particular is meaning or associations </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>enclothed cognition, which means that the clothing we wear can influence how we think </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>releasing this course, cost may cost the people to sing and act </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>act. For example, </span>in the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>way that affects our disequence. So, there is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lecture, the professor described </span>an <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>example, there is </span>interesting <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>experiments and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>experiment where one group of volunteers wore lab coats, while the other group just looked at lab coats. The volunteers in </span>the first <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>group is until </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>group, who wore </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>people are closed, closed. And </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>coats, noticed more differences in two pictures compared to those who only looked at </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>second group is only in just </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>coats. This shows that wearing </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>closed event. The people are </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lab coats made them behave </span>more <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>interested and affect </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>like doctors, highlighting </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>first group dance. This is called the Econoster Polynization.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>idea of enclothed cognition.</span></p>

<p>As we know, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>those of 5 people's filling by written </span>researchers <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>have </span>found that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>it will only </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>clothing can </span>affect <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>ourselves filling. And I really, really shares </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>how we perceive ourselves. In </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>experience. They divide one </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>experiment, they divided participants </span>into two <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>groups and in </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>groups. In </span>one <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>group </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>group, </span>each <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>of them wears </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>person wore </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>left coat. And in another group they just show </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lab coat, while </span>in the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>left half, they fought </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>other group, participants just looked at a lab coat placed </span>on the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>table around. And let the volunteers look at it to </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>table. To </span>test <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>a pretty, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>their observation skills, </span>the researchers <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>show </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>showed them </span>two pictures <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>for them. And researchers </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>that were almost identical. They </span>found <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>that the participants who wore the lab coats noticed more differences between the pictures. This shows that when </span>people <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>who were left of no taste, more difference. Because people assume he or she is the doctor.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>wear clothing associated with certain roles, like doctors, they start to act in ways that reflect those roles.</span></p>

<p>In <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>close to </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>co-agmentation, it's a phenomenal scent. The close and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>concept of enclothed cognition, </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>people will make changes in their </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>clothes we wear can significantly influence our </span>ability to process information and perform tasks. For example, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>long-wide codes </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>in the experiment mentioned, researchers used long white lab coats, </span>like <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>doctors wear will </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>those worn by doctors, to see if they would </span>improve people's attention and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>focus, because after you wear </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>focus. They divided participants into two groups: one group wore </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>wear, pay attention to detail more. The progressive experiments, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lab coats, while the other group simply looked at the lab coats without wearing them. Then, </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>say it's two groups. The first group, they wear the love codes, then it's like a doctor. The second group doesn't wear it. They test </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>tested </span>their ability to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>observe two images, and the images are almost the same. And they find the difference </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>notice differences </span>between two <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>similar </span>images. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>And finally, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The results showed that </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>people </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>participants </span>who <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>wear </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>wore </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>love codes, also have </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lab coats noticed </span>more <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>difference </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>differences </span>than <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>those who only looked at them. This illustrates how wearing certain clothing can affect our behavior and cognitive abilities, supporting </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>people who didn't wear the love codes. So, this is an enclosed correlation.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>idea of enclothed cognition.</span></p>

<p>The concept of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>enclosed </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>enclothed </span>cognition <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>suggests </span>that the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>close cannot </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>clothes we wear can affect not </span>only <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>affect </span>how <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>people perceive themselves, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>we see ourselves </span>but also <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>can change their </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>our </span>ability to process information and perform tasks. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>It can also cause people to think or affect their association. Here is an </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>For </span>example, <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>in the lecture, </span>the professor <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>mentioned </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>described an experiment that tested this idea. There were two groups of volunteers: one group wore lab coats, while the other group only looked at lab coats placed </span>in <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>front of them. The volunteers were asked to find differences between two similar pictures. The interesting part is that </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lecture. To test whether the people are actually </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>group </span>wearing the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lap codes and only seeing the lap codes, their ability to see the difference between two pictures, which is almost the same with each other. The experiment find that the people who are actually wearing lap codes can find the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lab coats noticed </span>more differences <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>between </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>than </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>two pictures, and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>group that just looked at them. This shows that wearing </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>people who only see </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lab coats made </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lap codes cannot find so that a lot </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>participants act more like doctors, demonstrating the concept </span>of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>difference. And this is called enclosed </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>enclothed </span>cognition.</p>

<p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>So in </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>In </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>writing page window, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lecture, </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>Corona issue not just have a reference from others, and also it can change some bodies </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>professor explained the concept </span>of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>places than if he wears some specific clothes in the lecture window that they have training that have </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>enclothed cognition through an experiment with lab coats. The study involved </span>two groups of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>people </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>volunteers. One group wore lab coats, while the other group just looked at lab coats placed in front of them. The volunteers were told that these were doctors' lab coats. After that, they were shown two pictures that were almost identical </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>one wear is the one </span>had <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>clothes and another group were nothing so they have two picture have some different and the professor let them </span>to find the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>different from it </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>differences. The results showed that the group wearing the lab coats noticed more differences than the group that only looked at them. This illustrates that wearing specific clothing, like a lab coat, can influence how we think </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>we know. As we so somebody wears a white coat have more</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>behave, making us more observant and detail-oriented.</span></p>

<p><strong>Camilia</strong></p>
<p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>in </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>In </span>this <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lecture </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lecture, </span>it <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>tells us the close for effects, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>discusses how clothing affects </span>people's behaviors and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>feelings. And not just for this, we also play a role </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>feelings, particularly </span>in performance <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>tasks. The professor describes an experiment where participants were divided into two groups. One group simply looked at a doctor's lab coat placed on a desk, while the other group actually wore the lab coats. The researchers wanted to see how these different conditions would affect their attention to detail. The results showed that those who wore the lab coats noticed more differences in two similar pictures compared to those who just looked at the lab coats. This demonstrates the concept of enclothed cognition, where wearing specific clothing can enhance one's ability to perform </span>tasks and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>so on. So there is an experiment for the professor. And they want to observe some of people while paying more details </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>behave </span>in <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>which kind of condition. They're divided people into groups. The first group is only while showing the close and putting it on </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>desk and just look at it. The other group will wear the clothes. They will wear the clothes. So they will take their picture in their minds. So they will find the differences from a close with the doctor's clothes. And the result shows us the people wear the clothes while seeing more details and more act like that. But the only show and group they will only see last details than the laptop.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>certain way.</span></p>

<p>The <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>enclosed combination is a phenomenon that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>concept of enclothed cognition refers to how the clothes we wear can affect our ability to </span>process <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the </span>information and perform <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>tasks. In </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>tasks. The professor gives </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>professor's lecture, </span>an example <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>was given </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>prove </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>illustrate </span>this <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>phenomenon. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>idea. </span>The scientists <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>show </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>conducted an experiment where they divided volunteers into two groups. One group wore lab coats, while </span>the <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>other group only looked at </span>lab <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>codes to </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>coats placed in front of them. To test their observation skills, </span>the volunteers <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>and they separate the volunteers in two groups. The first groups </span>were <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the lab codes and the second groups not were. The scientists put </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>shown </span>two similar pictures and <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>asked to find the differences between them. The results showed </span>that the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>volunteers to find how many difficulties. They found that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>group wearing </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>first groups found </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lab coats noticed </span>more <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>differences </span>than the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>second group. The result is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>group </span>that <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>just looked at them. This suggests that wearing </span>the <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lab coats made the volunteers </span>act <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>more </span>like <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>doctors, demonstrating </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>doctors. This is the example </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>concept </span>of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the enclosed combination.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>enclothed cognition.</span></p>

More </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>more </span>than just <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>now, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>how </span>we feel about <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>ourselves and it's really caused people to </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>ourselves; it can also change how we </span>think and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>act in </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>act. The professor explains an experiment where scientists used lab coats, like those worn by doctors, to see if wearing these clothes would change people's behavior. They divided volunteers into two groups: one group wore the lab coats, while the other group just looked at the coats on </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>way. And the scientist has experiments that in US, they pay more attention </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>table. The experiment tested their ability </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>show their behaviors and they divide two groups to volunteer to wear different clothes in different groups. And they put the clothes on the table and they will look at them to test their mobility. But they don't know </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>notice differences </span>between two <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>pictures, notice people and what they would look like so </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>similar pictures. The results showed </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>means if you wear some </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the volunteers wearing the lab coats noticed more differences than those who only looked at them. This suggests that wearing certain </span>clothes <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>like that, that means maybe you will </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>can influence how we </span>think and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>act in this way.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>behave, aligning with the idea of enclothed cognition.</span></p>

<p>The <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>enclosed </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>concept of enclothed </span>cognition <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>reflects the impact on </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>shows how clothing can influence </span>people's <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>behaviors of processing information and performing tasks which is brought by particular clothes. We all know that doctors care for this </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>behavior </span>and their ability to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>obtain attention to </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>process information. For example, in </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>details. The professor has </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>professor's lecture, he described an experiment with </span>two groups of volunteers. One <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is given by a </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>group wore </span>lab <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>coach, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>coats, </span>which <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is from </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>are associated with doctors, while </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>doctor, and another </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>other </span>group <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>was showing a </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>only looked at </span>lab <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>coach and was told to look at it. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>coats placed in front of them. </span>They <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>are told </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>were asked </span>to find <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the </span>differences between two <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>similar </span>pictures. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>And the group, which will, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The group wearing </span>the lab <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>coach can find </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>coats was able to notice </span>more differences than <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>other groups. So this explains </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>enclosed cognition.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>group that just looked at the coats. This illustrates how wearing specific clothing, like a doctor's lab coat, can enhance one's attention to detail and reflect the traits we associate with that clothing.</span></p>

<p>In the reading passage, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the writer propels a film that people with a particular kind </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>it discusses how wearing certain types </span>of clothing can <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>affect home people, percepts, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>influence how people perceive themselves. The lecture provides an example of this concept through a study. The researchers divided volunteers into two groups: one group wore lab coats, while the other group just looked at lab coats placed in front of them. They were told that these lab coats belonged to doctors. Then, both groups were asked to look at two similar pictures </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>self. In </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>identify </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lecture, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>differences between them. Interestingly, </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>professor, he was treated with a study which gave, in my two groups, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>group wearing </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>first group were Dr. Close and the second group was Schoen, left off about Dr. Close. And then after that, we will require them to watch similar photos about the clothes and then make them to something different in these two photos. And finally, it concludes that as a people, the groups which were Dr. Close can find the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lab coats noticed </span>more <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>details </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>differences </span>than the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>groups </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>group </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>we show on </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>only looked at them. This shows that wearing </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>laptop funding.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lab coats made the participants behave more like doctors, illustrating the concept of enclothed cognition.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>So the enclosed </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Enclothed </span>cognition <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is meant </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>means </span>that when people wear certain <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>clothes, they will behave or connect with </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>types of clothing, their behavior and mindset can change based on those clothes. For example, in </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>clothes. Here is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lecture, </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>example. The </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>professor talked about a study where </span>scientists <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>are always wearing </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>used </span>long white <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>clothes. Today just likes the doctor. And it means it helps them to pay </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lab coats, which are typically worn by doctors. This study showed that when volunteers wore these lab coats, they paid more </span>attention to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>more </span>details. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>And in </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>In </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>last years, in earlier scientists, that just group </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>experiment, there were </span>two <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>volunteers, and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>groups: </span>one group <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>wore the lab coats, and the other group just looked at them. They were given two pictures </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>they wear </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>were almost identical and asked to find the differences. The group wearing the </span>lab <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>clothes. And another group is just wears a doctor clothes. And then they give them a picture that is just the same, but not quite them. And then ask them how many different in the picture. And the result is that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>coats noticed more differences than </span>the group that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>wears </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>only looked at them. This shows that wearing </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>doctor clothes give </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lab coats helped the volunteers act </span>more <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>detail.

In </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>laptop often have a habitat to wear the laptop clothes. There are experiments about this.

And so the professor gives us </span>an <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>experience as an example. So there are </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>experiment involving </span>two groups <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>and the first </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>of people.

The experiment showed that the group wearing the lab coats noticed more differences </span>in <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>two similar pictures than </span>the <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>group that just looked at </span>the <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lab coats. This suggests that wearing </span>the <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lab coats helped </span>the <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>volunteers act more observantly, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>like doctors.</span></p>
