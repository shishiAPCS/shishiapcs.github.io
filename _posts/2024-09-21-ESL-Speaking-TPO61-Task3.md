# Task3
## Explain how the example from the lecture illustrates the concept of a diffusion effect.


## Reading

Diffusion Effect in Health Studies
When health education experts want to test the effectiveness of a program designed to improve a particular health condition, they often do a study with two groups of people. One group participates in the program, while the other does not, and the researchers compare the two groups to see if the program was effective in improving health. However, if the groups come into contact during the study, a diffusion effect may occur. Members of the group participating in the program may mistakenly share information about it with members of the other group. This often leads to the results of the study being useless.

## Listening

Now , listen to part of a lecture on this topic in a psychology class . So , okay , let's look at an example . A researcher wanted to study ways to prevent office workers from getting stiff and tired sitting all day at their desks . So he came up with a simple program of exercises , special stretches and things . And he wanted to know if this exercise program would keep people from getting so tired during the work day . So he did a study . He divided the workers in an office building into 2 groups , group A and group B . The researcher had group A do this new exercise program , these special exercises and stretches every day while group B they were told just to work as usual and group A was told not to tell group b about the exercises they were doing . The study went on for a couple weeks . And what happened was one day some people from group A were talking about how the exercises they were doing were making them feel great that they weren't becoming so stiff and tired during the work day . And some people from group B were sitting nearby and overheard them . So these people in group B decided to start doing the exercises too . So of course , the researcher wasn't able to tell how well the exercises actually worked , because people from both groups were doing them .

Group A <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>do </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>did the </span>exercise program every <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>day and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>day, while </span>group B <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>just do exercise usually.

So </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>help people who sit at desks all day. They divided the workers into two groups: Group A did the new exercises every day, while Group B continued their usual routine without knowing about the exercises. One day, some members of Group A were talking about how great </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>do a research </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>felt after doing the exercises, and some people from Group B overheard them. This led Group B </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>prevent </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>start doing the exercises too, which made it hard for the researcher to see if the </span>exercise <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>if exercise is hard.

Because </span>the group <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>which has </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>that was participating shared information about </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>studyers in with no results and group with the people not in there has </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>exercises they were doing, it affected </span>the results of the <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>study. The people in the first group felt great after doing the exercises, and some members </span>of the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>final of </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>second group overheard them talking. They decided to start doing </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>final project Just in </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>exercises too, which made it hard for </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>one </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>researcher to see how effective the program really was.

<p>The example <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>shows </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>illustrates </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>importance of </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>diffusion effect by showing how </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>exercise.

Group A was told not to share their exercise routine with group B. However, some members of </span>group A <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>ended up talking about how great they felt after exercising, </span>and <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>members of </span>group <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>B. For </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>B overheard them. This led </span>group <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>A, he told them </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>B </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>exercise </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>start doing the exercises too, which made it difficult for the researcher to determine how effective the program was. This situation shows how information can spread between groups and affect the results of </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>lot of time. And for group B, he asked them usually work. After several days, he asked for two groups of people. Group A people feel happy and relaxed, and they want to work. But the next group of people feel tired and hate their work. So it is important for people to have exercise.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>study.</span></p>

One day, one group talks about the exercise, which feels great in the time, but the B group thinks it's very hard, and the last time, the writer explains they do </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>program works since both groups are now doing </span>the same <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>exercise.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>exercises.</span></p>

However, some members of Group </span>B <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>members heard that, they started </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>overheard Group A talking about the benefits of the exercises and decided </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>study </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>try them as well. This situation created a diffusion effect because the information about the exercises spread from Group A to Group B, making it impossible for the researcher to determine how effective </span>the exercise <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>too. Just like </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>program was since both groups ended up doing </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>group A used the new exercise every day.

<p>The <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>university explains </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>example from the lecture shows the diffusion effect by explaining how two groups of office workers were involved in a study. Group A was doing a special exercise program, while Group B was not. However, some members of Group A talked about how great they felt after doing the exercises, and members of Group B overheard them. This led Group B </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>more and more people in two groups. The group A is discussions on health studies. The discussion is how </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>start doing the exercises too, which made it hard for the researcher </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>be healthy and what needs to be ate and how to longer it. The group B aims to build nearby homes which can make our health better.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>determine if the program was effective since both groups ended up doing the exercises.</span></p>

So they think students should </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>B started doing the exercises too, which made it hard for the researcher to determine if the </span>exercise <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>in the weekend for one hour.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>program was effective.</span></p>

<p>In order <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>students know </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>to understand </span>the importance of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the </span>health education, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>they have </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>researchers conducted </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>research, both for group </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>study with two groups, Group </span>A and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>group B. And they have the same people </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Group B, under similar conditions. Group A participated </span>in <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the same conditions for them. But the people who are in group A are keep exercises </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>an exercise program </span>for a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>week. Besides, the people who are in group </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>week, while Group </span>B <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>are not have it. And </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>did not. After a week, </span>the people in <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the group A, after the exercise for a week, they feel great. And they think </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Group A felt great and believed </span>the exercises <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>can cover their tired. But group B, they are </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>helped them avoid tiredness. However, Group B was </span>just working all <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>day and felt very tired. Eventually, some people from Group B overheard Group A talking about </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>day. They will feel very tired </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>exercises </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>not feeling good. So they are both exercise. After that, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>decided to try them too. This situation illustrates </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>students know </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>diffusion effect because it shows how information about the exercises spread from Group A to Group B, making it difficult for the researchers to determine how effective </span>the exercise <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>for the health education for other health.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>program really was.</span></p>

<p>The <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>professors </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>professor conducted a </span>study <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the participants before the classroom, so they make </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>with </span>two groups of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>people </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>participants. Group A was instructed </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>study it. And </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>do exercises, while group B continued their regular work without exercising. Over the weeks, </span>group A <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is often to exercise </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>reported feeling less tired </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>another </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>more energetic during their workday. However, some members of </span>group B <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is not allowed </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>overheard them talking about the exercises and decided </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>exercise, so they often work and continue to work. And after </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>try them too. This situation illustrates </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>week, group A's work does not have qualities </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>diffusion effect </span>because <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>they are very tired all </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>it shows how information shared between </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>days and also they want to sleep during </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>groups can impact </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>working time. And another group, group B, are still continuing to work, so it's important to </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>study's results. The researcher couldn't accurately assess how effective the </span>exercise <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>every day.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>program was because both groups ended up doing the exercises.</span></p>

<p>In the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>listening </span>lecture, the professor <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>explained that he </span>divided <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the participants into </span>two groups. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>One group named Group A, they have exercise after class. One group named Group B, and they just study after class. After few of weeks, </span>Group A <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>think exercise is a great way to relax, and it can solve the problem of one-day pressure. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>did exercises after class, while </span>Group B just <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>listening </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>continued their usual activities. After a few weeks, members of Group A started to feel great from the exercises and talked about them. Some people from Group B overheard this and decided they wanted to try the exercises too. This shows the diffusion effect because the information about the exercise program spread from Group A </span>to Group <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>A. So Group B want </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>B, which made it hard for the researcher </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>go to exercise. That tells us </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>determine how effective </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>health taking problem is more important, so students need more exercise after class.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>program was, since both groups ended up doing the exercises.</span></p>

<p>In the reading material, the professor <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>talked about </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>explained </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>definition </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>concept </span>of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>division affecting </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the diffusion effect in </span>health studies, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>which occurs when </span>one group of people <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>who participated </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>participating </span>in <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>an </span>experiment <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>wrongly shared </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>shares </span>information with <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>a </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>another </span>group <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>who didn't, will </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>that isn’t involved. This sharing can </span>lead to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the result useless. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>unreliable results. </span>To illustrate this, the professor provided <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>research as </span>an <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>example. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>example involving a study on office workers. </span>In <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the research, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>this study, </span>the researcher divided <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>people </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the workers </span>into two groups to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>find out </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>see </span>if <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>this </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>a special </span>exercise <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>program would help prevent them from getting tired </span>and <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>stiff during </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>special strategies worked. The first group of people were supposed </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>workday. Group A was instructed </span>to do the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>exercise </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>exercises </span>every day, while <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the second group just worked as a normal day. But </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Group B continued their usual work routine. However, </span>one day, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>when two </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>some </span>members of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>one group talked about </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Group A were discussing how great they felt after doing </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>exercise, it was heard by </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>exercises, and </span>a member of <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Group B overheard them. As a result, some people from Group B decided to try </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>second group. So </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>exercises too. This sharing of information made it impossible for </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>second group started </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>researcher </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>do </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>accurately determine how effective </span>the exercise <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>program was, </span>as <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>both groups ended up doing </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>first group, so the result is useless.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>exercises.</span></p>

<p>A health education expert <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>wants to have </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>conducts </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>test for the students. The experiment divides out the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>study by dividing students into </span>two groups. <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>One group participates in an exercise program, while the other group does not. </span>The <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>problem arises when members of the </span>first group <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>of </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>start talking about how the exercises help them feel less tired.

This sharing of information between the </span>groups <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is completely different.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>creates a diffusion effect, making it hard to determine how effective the program really was.</span></p>
