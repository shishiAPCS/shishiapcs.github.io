Illusion of Transparency 
When we experience strong emotions, we often believe, falsely, that other people can detect those emotions, even if we try to hide them. This false belief, that others can "see through us" and know even our innermost feelings that we try to hide, is called the illusion of transparency. Why are we susceptible to such an illusion? Why do we sometimes believe that our feelings are more obvious to others than they really are? Research suggests that the reason is this: when our emotions are very strong, we focus on them very intently and are extremely aware of them. This heightened awareness of our own feelings causes us to assume that they must be obvious to others as well.

## Listening

Now listen to part of a lecture in a psychology class. Now, before we get into some of the research in this area, let me tell you about something that just happened to me. That's a good example of this. The other night, I was invited to a dinner party at a friend's house. Now you should know that this friend, Mary, she's a really great cook, and I was really looking forward to this dinner. So that night everything was going great until she served the main dish. I could tell from the smell that she used a certain spice that I really dislike. It's garlic. I can't stand even the smell of it. And it was clear that this dish had a lot of garlic in it. Now, of course, I didn't want to offend my friend. I didn't want her to know I didn't like the food, so I tried to behave normally and eat as much as I could. But I was sure she could tell I wasn't enjoying it. Well, later, I was walking home with another friend, Mike. He'd also been at the dinner. I started telling him how worried I was that I had offended Mary. I told him, you know, about how I really hated garlic and how I was sure that Mary had noticed that I didn't like the meal, that I was sure I had insulted our host. Well, he was really surprised. He hadn't noticed that at all. In fact, he thought I seemed to be enjoying the meal. That made me feel a little better. But anyway, the next day, I called Mary to thank her for inviting me to the dinner. She was really pleased and talked about how nice the party was and how glad she was that everyone had liked the food so much. It was pretty clear from our conversation that she hadn't noticed anything. I guess my feelings hadn't been as obvious to Mary or to Mike as I thought they were.

**这里能否使用 He was also at the dinner？**

**对比分析**

**句子一**：He’d also been at the dinner.
**句子二**：He was also at the dinner.

### 语法和表意的区别

#### **句子一：He’d also been at the dinner.**
- **语法**：
  - **’d** 是 **had** 的缩写，构成 **过去完成时**（Past Perfect Tense）。
  - **结构**：主语（He） + 助动词（had） + 过去分词（been） + 其他成分（also at the dinner）。
- **表意**：
  - 表示“他”在某个过去的时间点之前已经参加过晚宴。
  - 强调动作发生的时间顺序，即“他”参加晚宴的动作先于叙述中的其他过去事件。

#### **句子二：He was also at the dinner.**
- **语法**：
  - **结构**：主语（He） + 系动词（was） + 其他成分（also at the dinner）。
  - **时态**：**一般过去时**（Simple Past Tense）。
- **表意**：
  - 简单陈述“他”也参加了晚宴。
  - 不强调时间顺序，仅作为一个过去的事实陈述。

#### 在原文中：
- **“Well, later, I was walking home with another friend, Mike, he’d also been at the dinner.”**
  - **“later”** 表示后续发生的事件，即“walking home”。
  - **“He’d also been at the dinner.”** 使用过去完成时，明确说明Mike在“walking home”之前已经参加了晚宴。
  - 这种时态的选择帮助听者理解事件的先后顺序，使叙述更加连贯和清晰。

#### 如果改为：
- **“Well, later, I was walking home with another friend, Mike, he was also at the dinner.”**
  - 虽然仍传达了Mike也参加了晚宴的信息，但缺乏对时间先后的明确强调。
  - 听者需要依赖上下文来推断时间关系，而不是通过时态本身。

**(16) 原文**：I started telling him how worried I was that I had offended Mary.  
**直译中文**：我开始告诉他我有多担心，因为我可能冒犯了玛丽。  
**句子结构分析**：  
- 主句为 “I started telling him (something)”  
- “how worried I was” 为宾语从句（名词性从句，说明程度），后接 “that I had offended Mary” 为进一步补充说明原因的从句。  
- 时态语态：started（一般过去时），was（一般过去时），had offended（过去完成时）。  
**词汇和短语解释**：  
- how worried I was：我有多担心  
- offend：冒犯

---

**(17) 原文**：I told him, you know, about how I really hated garlic and how I was sure that Mary had noticed that I didn’t like the meal, that I was sure I had insulted our host.  
**直译中文**：我告诉了他，你知道的，关于我多么讨厌大蒜，以及我多么肯定玛丽已经注意到我不喜欢那顿饭，还有我多么肯定我冒犯了我们的女主人。  
**句子结构分析**：  
- 主句为 “I told him (something)”  
- “about how I really hated garlic” 为介词 about 后的名词从句（说明我恨大蒜的程度）。  
- “how I was sure that Mary had noticed that I didn’t like the meal” 为另一层名词从句，其中包含 “that Mary had noticed (something)” 和 “that I didn’t like the meal” 两个从属从句。  
- “that I was sure I had insulted our host” 为另一个名词性从句，继续补充说明我当时的想法。  
- 时态语态：told（过去时），hated（过去时），was sure（过去时），had noticed（过去完成时），didn’t like（过去时），had insulted（过去完成时）。  
**词汇和短语解释**：  
- how I really hated garlic：我多么讨厌大蒜  
- notice：注意到  
- insult：侮辱，冒犯  
- host：女主人/主人

---

**词汇和短语解释**：  
- seem to be doing：似乎正在做某事  
- enjoy the meal：享用这顿饭

---

**(23) 原文**：She was really pleased and talked about how nice the party was and how glad she was that everyone had liked the food so much.  
**直译中文**：她非常高兴，并谈到了聚会有多么美好，以及她有多么高兴每个人都如此喜欢这道菜。  
**句子结构分析**：  
- 主干为 “She was really pleased and talked about (something)”  
- “how nice the party was” 与 “how glad she was that everyone had liked the food so much” 均为名词从句，作为 talked about 的宾语内容。  
- 在 “how glad she was” 从句中又包含从句 “that everyone had liked the food so much”。

**词汇和短语解释**：

**直译中文**：我想，我的感受并没有像我想的那样对玛丽或迈克显而易见。  
**句子结构分析**：  
- 主句为 “I guess (something)”  
- “my feelings hadn’t been as obvious … as I thought they were” 为主句中所猜测的内容，其中 “as I thought they were” 为比较状语从句，与 as…as 结构配合使用，对照我所想的程度。  
- 时态语态：guess（一般现在时），hadn’t been（过去完成时），thought（过去时），were（过去时）。  
**词汇和短语解释**：  
- obvious：明显的  
- as … as I thought：像我所想的那样
- **过去完成时态的使用**：
- **原因**：
  - **时间顺序**：首先，“I thought my feelings were obvious” 发生在更早的过去时态（“thought”是一般过去时），而“my feelings hadn’t been as obvious” 强调的是在“thought”之前，感受并不明显。
  - **逻辑关系**：使用过去完成时，明确了感受不明显的状态是在“我认为它们显而易见”之前的时间点。

<p>The illusion of transparency <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>refers to the belief </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>someone </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>others </span>can <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>say or emotions through us </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>easily see our emotions, even when we try to hide them. In the professor's story, he went to a dinner party where he didn’t like the food because it had garlic, which he dislikes. Although he tried to act normally and eat as much as he could, he felt sure </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>way behind. In this lesson in passage, the actor takes an example that there is a cook and she did a great job and everything is going on. The actor didn't like her food and he asked her friend to taste it and he told </span>his friend <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Mary, the cook, could tell he wasn’t enjoying the meal. However, when he talked to another friend, Mike, he learned </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>he didn't like her cook and her food but his friend </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Mike hadn’t </span>noticed <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>and his friend knows it and he didn't like his food. And he said that it is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>anything unusual. This shows </span>the illusion of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>transportation.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>transparency because the professor thought his feelings were obvious, but in reality, they were not.</span></p>

The </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>hide them. In the </span>listening passage, the professor <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>takes an example of himself. There is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>shares </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>parody </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>personal experience at a dinner party where </span>he <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>joined in and he is very </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>was </span>looking forward to the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>dinner. Until </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>meal. However, when he realized </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>one foot </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>dish was made with garlic, a spice </span>he <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is very spicy and he is very distracted. But </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>dislikes, </span>he tried to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>behave very normal, to </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>act normally and </span>not <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>let any other to see </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>show his discomfort. He was worried that his friend, Mary, would notice that he wasn't enjoying </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>unusual.

Later, </span>when he <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>talks </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>spoke to another friend, Mike, he learned that Mike hadn't noticed anything unusual at all.

<p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>Illusion </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The illusion </span>of transparency is a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>force </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>false </span>belief <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>that the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>where </span>people think others can detect <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>their </span>strong emotions, even <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>though </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>when </span>they <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>try to </span>hide <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>it well. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>them. </span>In the lecture, the professor <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>gives himself as example. Once </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>shares a personal example from a dinner party </span>he <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>went to </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>attended at his friend Mary's house. Everything was going well until the main dish was served, which had </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>party </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>lot </span>of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>his friend's marry, and everything was great before the food was taking out and the food is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>garlic in it—a spice he </span>really <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>spicy, which he doesn't like it. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>dislikes. </span>He tried to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>behave </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>act </span>normally and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>behave like </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>eat the food, but </span>he <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>enjoys this meal, but and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>was worried that </span>Mary <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>talks to him and thinks </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>could tell </span>he <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>tastes delicious. However, he thinks Mary knows, can detect notice his emotions, and after and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>wasn't enjoying it. Later, </span>when he <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>walks from what </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>talked </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the home, with </span>his friend Mike, he <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>told </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>expressed his concern that he had offended Mary. To his surprise, Mike hadn't noticed anything unusual and thought </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>American Mike </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>professor seemed </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>tell him </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>enjoy the meal. The next day, when the professor called Mary </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>notice, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>thank her, she also mentioned how pleased she was with the food </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>even though </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the party, showing that </span>she <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>thinks...</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>hadn't noticed his discomfort at all. This illustrates the illusion of transparency because the professor believed his feelings were obvious, but in reality, they were not.</span></p>

<p>In the lecture, the speaker <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>explained that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>shared a personal experience at a dinner party where </span>he <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>had </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>was worried about offending </span>his friend <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>cook very well, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Mary, who is a great cook. When she served a dish with garlic, which he dislikes, he tried to act normally and eat it. He thought that Mary could tell he wasn't enjoying the food, but later, when he spoke to another friend, Mike, he learned that Mike didn't notice anything unusual. This shows the illusion of transparency because even though the speaker felt strong emotions about the food, he assumed others could see his feelings, </span>but in <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the party she cooks not very well and she did not like the fruit. And he told his friend, but his friend told him to like this fruit, but his real feeling is not, he is this like the fruit tried when Joyce surprised and he surprised and she knows that so it is not good. When the experience strongly emotions will often believe basically that other people can detect those emotions.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>reality, they couldn't.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>From this </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>In the </span>lecture, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>this, this, uh, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the professor shares </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>white her is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>personal story about </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>gave </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>dinner party that illustrates the illusion of transparency.

<p><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>When we </span>experience strong emotions, we often think that other people can detect those <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>emotions </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>emotions, </span>even if <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>you </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>we </span>try to hide <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>them </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>them. The professor shares an example from a dinner party he attended at his friend Mary's house. He really looked forward to the dinner because Mary is a great cook. However, when she served the main dish, he noticed a strong garlic smell, which he dislikes. He didn’t want to hurt her feelings, so he tried to act normally </span>and <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>eat </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>professors say </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>food, but he was worried </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>there's something happen to him the professor is going to a party and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>she could tell he wasn’t enjoying it. Later, when he spoke </span>with his friend <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Mike, he learned that Mike hadn’t noticed anything unusual at all. This made the professor realize that </span>his <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>friends married at this time </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>feelings weren’t as obvious to others as he thought, illustrating </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>professors smell some spicy food that he didn't like and actually the man didn't like the married and the god and the man one but the man don't want his friend to know that he is disappointed and after this the man asked to ask a three-year friend his friends say that he did not know this at all and the man felt a little better so sometimes his friends didn't know</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>illusion of transparency.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>In </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>When people experience strong emotions, they often think that others can sense those feelings, even if they try to hide them. The professor's story illustrates this illusion of transparency. He felt worried that his friend Mary could tell he didn’t like </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>nature, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>garlic dish she made, even though he was trying to act normally. However, his other friend Mike didn’t notice anything wrong and thought he was enjoying </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>writer think when people feel, when people feel sense-sensual feeling and some people will detect these emotions. And the materialists give me an example. They think </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>meal. This shows that our own feelings can seem more obvious to us than </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>didn't like food, but one friend made food </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>really are </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>him. He is very enjoying, but other friends give him his done like two. So some people detect those emotions.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>others.</span></p>

<p>The <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>question is a one way </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>professor's </span>experience <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>a story, emotion. Reforging believable family is a mod to people can defect the emotion even if he trying to hate them. The boy thinks before just the boy before just the happen a really great trick. He thinks he really is like, but he short dinner. Short. He really supports with the money. He comes and reunites everyone in the convention. Conversation. Explain how the persons influence </span>at the dinner party <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>illustrates the illusion of transparency because he believed that his dislike for the garlic dish was obvious to his friend Mary, the host. Even though he tried to act normally, he was convinced that she could see through his facade </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>stress </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>tell he wasn't enjoying </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>airship </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>meal. However, when he spoke with another friend, Mike, he learned that Mike hadn't noticed anything amiss. This shows that while the professor was very aware </span>of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>transverse.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>his own feelings, he mistakenly assumed that others could detect them too. In reality, his emotions were not as transparent to them as he thought.</span></p>

<p>When people <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>are upset, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>experience strong emotions, </span>they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>are afraid of the emotions. They will make sure their faces, and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>often worry that others can see what they're feeling, even </span>when they <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>struggle, they see sense of their power of your heart. That is the view on the galaxy for dawn, the view of the third. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>try to hide it. </span>In the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>passage, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>professor's story about </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>man gives the idea of himself. Just like the three examples. He didn't like the smell of the garbage, of his neighborhood, and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>dinner party, </span>he felt <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>strong sense </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>anxious about not liking the food because it had garlic in it. He thought his friend Mary could tell he wasn't enjoying the meal, but in reality, she didn't notice at all. This shows the illusion </span>of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>emotions that hurts </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>transparency because </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>past now.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>professor assumed his feelings were obvious to others, but they really weren't.</span></p>

<p>The illusion of transparency is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>a technique for people to know what emotions and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the belief that </span>other people <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>and their feelings and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>can easily see our emotions, even when we try to hide them. In </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>people hide, just like the example given by the professor. The professor was invented </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>professor's example, he went to </span>a <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>dinner </span>party <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>by Mary and Mary </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>at his friend Mary's house, who </span>is a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>good </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>great </span>cook. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>And for Mary's cool dishes, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>When he smelled </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>professor smells a little bit spicy and then </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>garlic in the dish, which </span>he <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>doesn't like so </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>really dislikes, </span>he tried to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>behave normally. And better </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>act normally and eat as much as he could. Later, </span>when he <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>returned </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>talked </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>home </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>his friend Mike, he expressed his worries that Mary might have noticed he wasn't enjoying the meal. However, Mike was surprised </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>with his friends, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>said </span>he <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>talked out his worried and his friends says he didn't notice that this makes </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>hadn't noticed anything at all, which made </span>the professor feel better. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>But </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The </span>next <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>day he asks the Mary and Mary is not as anything, anything. So this makes </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>day, when </span>the professor <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>feel a little bit surprised and this is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>thanked Mary, it was clear she hadn't realized he didn't like the food. This shows how the professor's feelings weren't as obvious to others as he thought, illustrating </span>the illusion <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>of</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>of transparency.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The illusion </span>of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>transfer easy </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>transparency </span>is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>a </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>when people think that others can easily see their </span>strong <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>emotion that people want </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>emotions, even when they try </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>hide. But they think people can't detect them, but actually people already detect </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>hide </span>them. For example, the professor was invited <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>to a dinner party </span>by <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>his friend </span>Mary, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>people </span>who <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>could act cooking for dinner. But the Mary serves the food that the professor didn't like. But </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>is a great cook. However, when she served a dish with garlic, which he really dislikes, </span>he tried to hide his <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>emotion </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>feelings </span>and <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>just behave normally, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>act normally </span>because he <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>can't bear </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>didn’t want to hurt her feelings. He thought that Mary could tell he wasn’t enjoying </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>smile, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>meal, </span>but <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>later, when </span>he <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>don't want her </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>talked </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>marry. And he asked her friend. But actually, </span>his friend <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>already knew </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Mike, Mike said he hadn’t noticed anything unusual. The next day, when he called Mary to thank her, she also didn’t realize he didn’t like the food. This shows </span>that <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>his feelings weren’t as obvious to them as </span>he <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>dislocated. And tomorrow, the Mary also knew that. So it's called </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>believed, illustrating </span>the illusion of transparency.</p>

The professor shares a personal story </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>perform in the area. And that is because the people themselves pay highly awareness on themselves and in the lesson and passage, the professor gives an example of himself. First, one day, he </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>illustrate this. He </span>was invited to a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>friend house </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>dinner party at a friend's house, who is a great cook, </span>and <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>he was really looking forward to it. However, when the main dish was served, he noticed it had a lot of garlic, which he really dislikes. He didn't want to hurt </span>his <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>friend. It </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>friend's feelings, so he tried to act normally and eat the food, but he </span>was <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>a really nice cook. He was very expected </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>worried that she could tell he wasn't enjoying it. Later, when he talked </span>to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>this dinner. And when they are waiting for the cook, the smell is that he didn't really dislike it. And she don't want his friends to know that. And after the cook, after dinner, he let </span>another friend, Mike, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>and </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>he found out that </span>Mike <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>didn't know that he didn't like this meat.

It </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>transparency, which </span>is when a person has strong emotions, but <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>someone </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>they believe that others </span>can detect these emotions. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>In the conversations, the </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The </span>professor <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>gave an example of him. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>shares his own experience at a dinner party. </span>He was invited by a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>motherly party, by </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>friend who is </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>good </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>great </span>cook, and everything was <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>great.

<p>The concept of <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the </span>illusion of transparency <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is an appropriate </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>refers to the </span>belief that people can <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>easily </span>detect <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>emotion, that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>our emotions, </span>even <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>with </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>when we try to hide them. In the lecture, the professor shares </span>a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>10 hour bath you hide. And the lecture illustrates </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>personal experience to illustrate </span>this <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>concept by using the example of himself. Once told me he </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>idea. He talks about </span>going to a <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>part of </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>dinner party at </span>his friend <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>Mary, Mary </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>Mary's house, who </span>is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>good at cooking and everyone wants to know </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>known for her great cooking. However, </span>when the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>mind </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>main </span>dish <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>comes, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>was served, he realized </span>it <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>contains </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>contained garlic, which he really dislikes. Although he didn't want to hurt Mary's feelings, he tried to act normally and eat </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>spicy garlic which is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>food. He was worried that Mary would notice he wasn't enjoying the meal. Later, when he spoke with his friend Mike, he learned that Mike hadn't noticed anything unusual and thought he seemed to enjoy the food. This showed </span>the professor <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>really dislike. And </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>that his feelings weren't as obvious to others as </span>he <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>tries to act like normal because she wants to be like Mary upset. And finally, after he finishes </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>believed, highlighting </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>part he acts as his friend and his friends surprise, he finds his enjoyment in the milk. Also, Mary didn't find his distinguished and he thinks she's very enjoying his milk.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>illusion of transparency.</span></p>

<p>In <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the </span>psychology class, <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>the professor shared a personal experience that illustrates the illusion of transparency. He attended a dinner party where he didn't like the food because </span>it <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>took </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>had garlic in it, which he dislikes. Even though he was trying to hide his feelings, he assumed his friend Mary, the host, could see that he wasn't enjoying the meal. However, after the dinner, when he talked to another friend, Mike, he found out that Mike thought he had enjoyed the food. This shows that the professor’s strong feelings </span>about the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>revolutions </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>food were not as obvious to others as he believed, demonstrating the illusion </span>of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>the transplant. First, the transplant divided to a person to do the transplant. The first one is a food and attached it. The second one is, I don't have the memory to remember what to do. Then, they talked about, and then, on time, again, the one person sings. This food is a, it can't test it so much, and the other can't have a test to eat it. And so, it is, the illusions of the transplant.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>transparency.</span></p>

<p><span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>He gave an example that he went to </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>The professor shared a personal experience from a </span>dinner party <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>and he can't understand the food, but </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>where </span>he had <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>his </span>strong emotions <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>about the food. He disliked the garlic in the dish but tried to act like he was enjoying it, thinking that others could see through his facade. However, his friend Mike didn't notice anything wrong </span>and <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>thought </span>he <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>was happy. This illustrates the illusion of transparency because even though the professor </span>felt <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>he looked like enjoying the party. And everybody believed </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>his emotions were obvious, they weren't perceived </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>he is very happy and enjoys the party.

<p>The article <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>discusses the illusion of transparency, which </span>is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>talked about </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>when people believe others can easily see their emotions. In </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>issue </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>professor's experience at the dinner party, he felt that his dislike for the garlic dish was obvious to his friend Mary. However, she didn't notice his discomfort at all. This shows how our strong emotions can make us think others are aware </span>of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>transferences. This is the experience of strong emotions, and the people will be fancily. When the proportions experience as the gender party influences the influences of transferences.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>what we're feeling, even when they really aren't.</span></p>

So, this thing, because in others people's eyes, it's the same for that. So, and there's a man, and the man is the president of the inner party. This thing is </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>his dislike </span>for the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>soul spicy. And he's not, and he's sad. And in </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>garlic dish was obvious to his friend Mary. He was so focused on his own feelings of discomfort that he assumed she could see how he felt. However, when he spoke to another friend afterward, he learned that Mary had no idea he was unhappy with </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>next morning, he refers and says, what's the nice part of sports team.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>meal.

<p>The material <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>tells us </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>explains </span>that <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>if </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>when </span>we try to hide our emotions, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>it's </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>we experience something </span>called the illusion of transparency. <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>And </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>This means we think others can see our feelings even when we try to hide them. In </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>reason why we feel that is we focus that </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>professor's story, he was at a dinner party and really disliked the garlic </span>in the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>emotions that we are aware. And the man who is a ten to ten friend, heard and he didn't like this. The woman made that much hidden. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>food. </span>He <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>didn't tell the woman and she </span>tried to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>be normal. Then </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>act normal, but he was worried that his friend Mary could tell he didn’t enjoy it. Later, when </span>he talked to <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>other friends what </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>another friend, Mike, </span>he <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>worried. He said, of course, they think they enjoy it. And after this talk, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>found out that Mike hadn’t noticed anything wrong. This made him feel better because it showed that his feelings weren't as obvious to others as </span>he <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>felt better than he thinks, because the married and the married is filled with feelings in this conversation.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>thought.</span></p>

However, when he later talked to another friend, Mike, he found out that Mike hadn’t noticed anything wrong. This shows that even when we are very aware of our own feelings, like the professor was about his dislike for garlic, it doesn't mean others </span>can <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>be detected or hiding by people.

<p>When we have strong emotions, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>fastly, </span>we <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>always </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>often </span>think that people can detect these <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>emotions.

After that, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>enjoy the meal and not show my feelings because </span>I <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>tell Max ideas like this food, but </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>didn't want to offend her. Later, when I spoke to my friend </span>Mike <span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>about it, he </span>was <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>shocked because </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>surprised and said </span>he <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>think </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>thought </span>I was <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>enjoyed.

This shows the illusion of transparency because </span>I <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>thank for married, and Mary think I will enjoy it too.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>believed my feelings were obvious to others, but in reality, they were not.</span></p>

<p>The lecture <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>is talking about </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>discusses </span>the illusion of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>transparency. </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>transparency, which is when people believe that others can easily see their emotions. </span>The <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>research proves that if people's emotion </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>professor shares a personal example to illustrate this. He was invited to a dinner party at his friend Mary's house, who </span>is <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>growing, they always close out what they wanted to do </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>a great cook. However, he dislikes garlic, and when he noticed it </span>in <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>France, and they are extremely aware of them. And </span>the <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>professor gives a true example by himself. One day, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>dish, </span>he was <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>invited by </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>worried that Mary could tell he wasn't enjoying the meal. Even though he tried to act normally, he thought </span>his <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>best friend Mary O'Kook. And it is like the dinner is the party, but </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>feelings were obvious. Later, when </span>he <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>prevents his feelings, very delicious. And after the party, </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>talked to </span>his friend Mike, <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>would go home with him together. And both </span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>he found out that Mike hadn’t noticed anything wrong and thought he was enjoying the food. This shows that the professor's feelings were not as transparent to others as he believed, illustrating the illusion </span>of <span style='color:red;font-weight:700;text-decoration:line-through;'>Mike and Mary believe that he also thinks dinner is delicious.</span><span style='color:green;font-weight:700;'>transparency.</span></p>
